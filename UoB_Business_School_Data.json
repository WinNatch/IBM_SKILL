Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nMultinational companies (MNCs) are increasingly forced to think about the (intended and\/or unintended) externalities of their cross-border activities as they experience growing pressures from consumers, NGOs, investors, and other stakeholders. In this unit, you'll delve into the intricate world of global value chains, pinpointing the opportunities and challenges that modern enterprises face, particularly in social and environmental spheres. Through real-world case studies, you'll not only identify pressing sustainability issues but also craft actionable solutions. This unit isn't about theoretical knowledge; it's a call to action. No longer can businesses exist in isolated bubbles, blind to their broader impact. As future leaders, you'll be at the forefront of navigating complex challenges that go beyond national borders and impact millions of lives.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme, the 'Sustainability in Global Value Chains' unit serves as a vital elective that enriches students understanding of sustainability, a key global challenge. This unit will provide students with a targeted focus on implementing sustainable practices in global businesses, equipping them to address issues such as human rights, forced labour, deforestation, and more. As an elective, this unit provides an invaluable opportunity for students to acquire actionable, real-world knowledge that significantly enhances their strategic thinking capabilities.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn the \"Sustainability in Global Value Chains\" unit, students will delve into the multi-layered challenges and opportunities of sustainable business practices in a global context. The curriculum is structured around essential themes, starting with an overview of global value chains and their inherent sustainability issues. Key topics include Global Value Chain theories in International Business, social upgrading and decent work, forced labour, and environmental upgrading. These will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the practical complexities multinationals face when implementing sustainable practices in international markets.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nWith this unit, students will gain the capacity to articulate specific sustainability challenges that multinational companies encounter in their global operations. students critical thinking will expand to include a multi-stakeholder view, encompassing local communities, suppliers, and NGOs. This broadened perspective will be matched by student?\u00c2\u0080?s ability to critically evaluate a diverse range of information related to sustainability and global value chains. With this blend of knowledge and analytical skills, students will be empowered to conceive and propose actionable solutions to sustainability issues that companies and other stakeholders face.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to\n\n1) Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of sustainability issues that multinational companies face when managing their global value chains\n\n2) Become proficient at describing the roles and perspectives of relevant stakeholders within these chains, including local communities, suppliers, and NGOs\n\n3) Critically evaluate various forms of information related to sustainability and global value chains\n\n4) Develop a diverse range of solutions that can be implemented by companies and other actors to address these critical challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit on Sustainability in Global Value Chains is structured to create a student-centered experience that spans over 10 weeks with a one-hour lecture and a two-hour tutorial per week. The aim of the unit is to encourage active participation and critical thinking. In each weekly session, there will be targeted presentations followed by sub-group discussions to create an interactive learning environment. This pedagogical structure is closely aligned with the unit's learning outcomes. The presentations will provide foundational knowledge to understand the complexities of sustainability in global value chains, while the discussions will enable you to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios. The student-centered design will facilitate peer-to-peer learning, which is essential for grasping the multi-stakeholder perspectives that this unit encompasses.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week's session has a distinct agenda, aligned with the comprehensive outline provided in the unit manual. These agendas guide teams in preparing slides that are instrumental in building towards your final case analysis report and presentation.\n\nEvery week, each team will present about 5 slides to other peer groups. While these presentations aren't graded, they serve a crucial role: they are team?\u00c2\u0080?s opportunity to receive targeted feedback from both peers and the instructor.\n\nThis incremental approach not only resolves immediate questions but also helps students iteratively refine their understanding and application of unit concepts. This step-by-step process is key to preparing students for the final graded assignments, ensuring that they are equipped to produce well-informed, insightful analyses.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nIndividual Task(35%): Students are required to choose one business case from the list provided. Based on the chosen case, each student will develop their own essay of approximately 1500 words that connects the sustainability report of a firm.\n\nSustainability report analysis (35%; 1500 words)\n\nGroup Tasks(65%): The structure and governance of a GVC can vary depending on the specific case, and so will the major sustainability issues. In the group assignment, students will need to analyze and present the most significant environmental and\/or social issues of a GVC of a company. The analysis can be conducted on the industry, country, product, or firm level.\n\nFinal Case analysis report (40%; 3500 words)Final Case presentation (25%; 15 minutes)\n\nThe individual task will support ILOs 1, 2, 3, and 4. The final case analysis report of group tasks will address ILOs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the final case presentation of group tasks specifically will specifically address ILOs 2 and 4.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit overall will be re-assessed using like-for-like assessments:\n\nIf the student fails in an individual task, they are expected to resubmit a 1,500-word sustainability report analysis on business cases other than the one selected in their initial attempt. If students fails in group tasks, they are expected to submit a 5-minute recorded audio presentation and 1,000 word report on one noteworthy environmental or social issue of a GVC of a company.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important\n\nThe expanding availability of data and computational power means that analytics approaches have become pervasive in business decision-making. This is especially true in supply chain management. A knowledge of what data science and analytical approaches are used and how they are employed is essential for the supply chain manager. Analytics subdivides into three branches: (1) descriptive ?\u00c2\u0080? summarising data to extract meaning. This is especially important in supply chain management in the context of identifying whether target metrics are being achieved; (2) predictive ?\u00c2\u0080? techniques to allow measures for which future forecasts are required to support planning e.g. demand; (3) prescriptive ?\u00c2\u0080? using models to analyse available data for advice on best, or optimal, decisions.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe Supply Chain Management pathway in the programme MSc Data Science for Business provides you with strategic and operational insight into how operations and supply chains can be designed and manage their data. As part of this process, whether to consider the performance of various options or as information to support the strategic or operational choice process, analytical information will be essential. This unit provides you with the tools to produce and understand data science and technical information to support informed supply chain and operations management.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces you to some important methods relevant to supply chain management from the fields of analytics, namely descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. Some principal descriptive analytical methods for understanding data related to various aspects of management of a supply chain are investigated e.g. exploratory descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis. For predictive analytics, causal (regression) and time series forecasting methods will be considered. For prescriptive analytics, inventory optimisation, service provision and resource allocation are crucial elements in the design of efficient and effective supply chains. This unit introduces you to the analytical techniques from the discipline of management science required to be able to do this.\n\nHow will students personally be different as a result of this unit\n\nOn completion of this unit, you will realise that knowledge of analytics plays a key role in supply chain management. You will be able to select appropriate techniques for different situations and then implement and interpret the result of the analysis into useful information for key stakeholders.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\n1. Apply the main data science such as descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytical models and tools for supply chain management.2. Use computer software to implement solutions to supply chain analytics problems.3. Interpret analytical results to form an opinion on a given business question.4. Demonstrate a critical approach to the selection of analytical tools for given problems and the opportunities and limitations inherent in both the toll and the application environment.5. Distinguish different approaches when communicating technical information, whether orally or written, to different audiences, whether specialist or generalist, strategic or tactical.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe teaching method will be centred around a 3-hour lectorial session each week for ten weeks. The lectorial contains a combination of lectures, computer workshops and case study analyses. Post lectorial you will be required to work independently on problem-based study. Lecture elements are aimed at communicating the main methods, techniques and ideas of the unit. Computer workshop elements demonstrate the implementation of important calculations and provide an opportunity to discuss interpretation of output. You will also be expected to spend a significant number of hours on independent study, practising formative problems that require the implementation of covered techniques in order to fully develop your understanding of the material. These will be provided each week with solutions made available the following week. Office hours provide an opportunity to receive feedback on solutions that are not clear.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week you will be provided with questions to practice the tools and techniques introduced in that week. Solutions to these problems will be available the following week. Office hours are available to clarify elements on solutions that are not clear. The formative exercise in analysing and reporting on a case study will be provided, in preparation for the summative case study task. These cover ILO 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThere will be two equally weighted individual case studies, each 1500 words (2*50%).The first will be based on predictive analytics. It covers all learning outcomes from prescriptive analytical models.The second will be based on the application of descriptive and predictive analytics. These two activities cover ILO 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nIf you do not pass the unit in aggregate across the two assessments, you will be eligible for reassessment. Reassessment will be targeted at the specific components in which the pass mark was not achieved. Reassessment will involve new case studies for the failed components.Case study 1 (50%): if you fail this assessment, you will be required to complete a new case study based on predictive analytics (covering ILOs related to prescriptive analytical models).Case study 2 (50%): if you fail this assessment you will complete a new case study based on descriptive and predictive analytics (covering all ILOs).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

These lectorials are made up of two components. The first half of the lectorial focusses on content delivery through a lecture format, the second half focusses on seminar activities that focus on content delivered during the lecture. The latter will involve deep academic conversations, case studies, presentations from the groups (yourselves), as well as game-play and simulation based activities. Optional advice and feedback sessions will be provided during the term for students to come and discuss content or the assessment. Students will be required to do some preparation reading and activities before the sessions. All learning material will be available in the Blackboard virtual learning environment for the module. Additional readings and discussion boards will be available for students who wish to acquire, and engage in, deeper learning around operations management. This will strengthen peer interaction and your critical thinking and writing skills. It is also a place for students to ask any questions about the module and, as one of the first modules you?\u00c2\u0080?ll complete, a place to introduce yourselves to your classmates. Students are advised to set aside time to review the weekly material and plan when they will work through them.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week's session (a 3 hour lectorial) has a distinct agenda, aligned with the comprehensive outline provided in the unit manual. Every week, each individual will be faced with either a case study based on a real organisation or a game-play activity. In two of the ten weeks, students will be asked to prepare a short presentation on the case activity they have just completed in their groups. While these activities aren't graded, they serve a crucial role: they are a groups opportunity to receive targeted feedback from both peers and the instructor during the lectorial. Each activity, whether case activity or game play, is designed to facilitate the development of your knowledge and skills relevant for the summative tasks. The chosen approaches not only resolves immediate questions but also helps students iteratively refine their understanding and application of unit concepts.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important\n\nThe expanding availability of data and computational power means that analytics approaches have become pervasive in business decision making. This is especially true in supply chain management. A knowledge of what analytical approaches are used and how they are employed is essential for the supply chain manager. Analytics subdivides into three branches: (1) descriptive ?\u00c2\u0080? summarising data to extract meaning. This is especially important in supply chain management in the context of identifying whether target metrics are being achieved; (2) predictive ?\u00c2\u0080? techniques to allow measures for which future forecasts are required to support planning e.g. demand; (3) prescriptive ?\u00c2\u0080? using models to analyse available data for advice on best, or optimal, decisions.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe programme MSc Global Operations and Supply Chain Management provide you with strategic and operational insight into how operations and supply chain can be designed and managed. As part of this process, whether to consider performance of various options, or as information to support the strategic or operational choice process, analytical information will be essential. This unit provides you with the tools to produce and understand that technical information to support informed supply chain and operations management.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces you to some important methods relevant to supply chain management from the fields of analytics, namely descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. Some principal descriptive analytical methods for understanding data related to various aspects of management a supply chain are investigated e.g. exploratory descriptive statistics, correlation analysis. For predictive analytics, causal (regression) and time series forecasting methods will be considered. For prescriptive analytics, inventory optimisation, service provision and resource allocation are crucial elements in the design of efficient and effective supply chains. This unit introduces you to the analytical techniques from the discipline of management science required to be able to do this.\n\nHow will students personally be different as a result of this unit\n\nOn completion of this unit, you will realise that knowledge of analytics plays a key role in supply chain management. You will be able to select appropriate techniques for different situations and then implement and interpret the result of the analysis into useful information for key stakeholders.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students should be able to:\n\nDemonstrate understanding of and apply the main descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytical models and tools for supply chain managementUse computer software to implement solutions to supply chain analytics problemsInterpret analytical results to form an opinion on a given business questionDemonstrate a critical approach to the selection of analytical tools for given problems and the opportunities and limitations inherent in both the toll and the application environmentDistinguish different approaches when communicating technical information, whether orally or written, to different audiences, whether specialist or generalist, strategic or tactical.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe teaching method will be centred around a 3-hour lectorial session each week for ten weeks. The lectorial contains a combination of lecture, computer workshop and case study analysis. Post lectorial you wlll be required to work independently on problem-based study. Lecture elements are aimed at communicating the main methods, techniques and ideas of the unit. Computer workshop elements demonstrate the implementation of important calculations and provide an opportunity to discuss interpretation of output. You will also be expected to spend a significant number of hours on independent study, practicing formative problems that require implementation of covered techniques in order to fully develop your understanding of the material. These will be provided each week with solutions made available the following week. Office hours provide an opportunity to receive feedback on solutions that are not clear.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week you will be provided with questions to practice the tools and techniques introduced in that week. Solutions to these problems will be available the following week. Office hours are available to clarify elements on solutions that are not clear. In week 4 the class will be a formative exercise in analysing and reporting on a case study, in preparation for the summative case study task.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThere will be two equally weighted individual case studies, 1500 words each.\n\nThe first will be based on predictive analytics. It covers all learning outcomes from the perspective of prescriptive analytical models.\n\nThe second will be based on the application of descriptive and predictive analytics. It covers all learning outcomes from the perspective of descriptive and predictive analytics.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nIf students do not pass the unit in aggregate across the two assessments and they are eligible for a reassessment, they will be reassessed in like-for-like assessments of the components for which they have not achieve the pass mark.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0017).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs).

This leads us to ask: what determines rewards and the distribution of benefits from work? How do HR managers promote and protect health and safety at work, ensure respect and dignity, provide meaningful work, prevent discrimination, harassment and violence, guarantee democracy and promote employee voice? In short, how do we ?\u00c2\u0080?future proof?\u00c2\u0080? the human resources of the organisation? This unit aims to understand the myriad causes of conflict and the foundations of cooperation at work. More importantly, how to understand how these conflicts are resolved and how cooperation is maintained in different socio-economic, political and cultural settings.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit provides students with a strong conceptual foundation for understanding human resource management and the future of work. The unit does this by introducing key theories of control, conflict and cooperation from the fields of human resource management and employment studies as well as key debates in the future of work. This foundation is then further developed in the programme?\u00c2\u0080?s concurrent and subsequent units that take a more specialised focus on specific topics.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit content is research-rich and updated annually to ensure it covers cutting edge developments in human resource management and the future of work. Topics include key theories from the fields of human resource management and employment studies on control, conflict and cooperation and how they are shaped by different socio-economic, political and cultural settings. The content also covers key and emerging issues in the future of work.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThe unit will equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to manage people in a variety of social and institutional settings, in ?\u00c2\u0080?old?\u00c2\u0080? and ?\u00c2\u0080?new?\u00c2\u0080? industrial sectors, in their home or host country, in the public, private or ?\u00c2\u0080?third sector?\u00c2\u0080?. By the end of the unit, students will be able to: demonstrate knowledge and understanding of human resource policies and practices in different countries, industries, and firms. Apply social, economic and political theories to questions pertinent to the management of human resources in an international context. Demonstrate an ability to evaluate and formulate policies relating to the management of workforces in international organisations, including conformance to national law and international labour standards. Exhibit the ability to work collaboratively with others to solve problems associated with the management of people across borders and apply their knowledge and intellectual abilities to new human resource management situations. Communicate ideas, analyses, results, conclusions associated with HRM in the global economy to a range of audiences through comprehensive written and oral communication skills.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify the generic challenges facing HR managers in a global economy.Discuss the specific challenges facing HR managers in trans-national corporations.Utilise appropriate theories of HRM to understand how to manage people in different social, institutional and cultural settings.Recognise skills to manage people with dignity and respect, efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit will be taught through weekly lectures and tutorials. The unit structure offers 30 contact hours in total (10 x 2-hour lectures and 10 x 1-hour tutorials). The lectures have the principal purpose of introducing the content of the course and are research-informed being based on current empirical research by experts in the field. The tutorials provid students with an opportunity to test their understanding of the key concepts and develop their analytical skills through discussions based on key readings as well as role plays and other interactive activities. The lectures and tutorials will be structured around weekly topics. The unit structure offers 30 contact hours in total. The remaining 170 learning hours will be spent in independent study and in the preparation of assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nIndividual 500-word write-up of a podcast of the student?\u00c2\u0080?s choice from the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development?\u00c2\u0080?s website (non-assessed). This task will provide an opportunity to learn about how a specific future of work issue is affecting human resource management in practice. You will receive feedback on your understanding of the issue, application of concepts from the unit, and approach to written work. This task is scheduled for the middle of the unit so that feedback can be learnt from for the summative assessments.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nGroup 20-minute presentation on a company?\u00c2\u0080?s HR practice (30% of overall unit mark), ILOs 1-4. This task is scheduled at the end of the unit.\n\nIndividual 2000-word essay on a HR issue (70% of the unit), ILOs 1-4. This task is scheduled at the end of the unit.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\nGroup assessment\n\nMarks for group work are awarded based on the overall submission but also in light of the equity share statement written and signed by group members. Group work is not appropriate for resubmission on this unit, and will, therefore, be replaced by a 1,000-word individual reflection on the topic presented this will account for 30% of the overall unit mark and covers all the intended learning outcomes.\n\nIndividual 2000-word assignment\n\nThis individual 2000-word assignment will be reassessed via another individual 2000-word assignment on HR challenges (70% of the overall unit mark) that will cover all of the above intended learning outcomes.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0131).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is the unit important?\n\nThe relationship between labour, capital and the state within its broad political, historical, economic and social context is one that is experiencing dramatic changes. These changes raise important questions. Are traditional forms of labour market regulations sustainable and is it possible to produce voice, equity and efficiency at the same time? Will unions continue to play an important role in helping to protect the interests of workers? Do national institutions, actors and policymakers still have the most important role to play in shaping employment relations? What part do new governance actors at the international level have to play? Are new forms of representation developing and will they be as effective? This unit will provide students with the knowledge and understanding and conceptual tools they need to answer these and the many other employment relations-related questions raised by globalisation, technological advances and the increasing proliferation of trans-national organisations and their value chains.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nWithin the context of the MSc Human Resource Management and the Future of Work, this unit provides a valuable international perspective on a range of contemporary issues facing even those workers whose jobs constitute decent work. As such, students will be able to engage with some of the biggest issues facing current and future generations of managers and policymakers in relation to work in the global economy.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content of the unit covers the identification of some of the key issues facing workers, both today and in the future, in the international labour market. This includes investigation of forced labour and modern slavery, labour migration and capital mobility, the rise of the multinational company and the growing dominance of global value chains. Furthermore, the unit will deal with the main international actors and frameworks that seek to regulate and govern the international employment relationship, in order to reduce the risks it brings to workers and promote decent work.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThrough studying this unit, students will have an enhanced knowledge of key issues in international employment relations and their governance, in addition to understanding the complexities involved in addressing the challenges that result from them. As a result, students will have developed their research, writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills, as well as their ability to find appropriate solutions to difficult problems.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand and explain the impact of the growing internationalisation of production, technological advancement and changing nature of the workplace for employment relations and the governance of labour.Describe and apply the theories of employment relations and governance to a range of contemporary cases and organisations.Discover and communicate the challenges and opportunities to the parties, processes and outcomes of the employment relationship.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching is conducted through ten weekly lectures (two hours) and seminars (one hour). The lectures are a mixture of teaching and interaction, and seminars are student-centred. This approach is taken in order to provide students with two important elements to their learning. On the one hand, this approach provides students with explanations and applications of theories as well as up-to-date examples and case studies. On the other hand, there is the opportunity for students to engage, ask questions, provide their views, and discuss and debate what they learn each week with their peers. This constates practice for the development of arguments that will be invaluable for the summative assessment. There is also weekly reading from journal articles chosen to represent a wide range of issues central to international employment relations, including forced labour, multinational companies, global value cahins and international governance of labour and employment. These are up-to-date research papers that will provide students with the most recent developments and knowledge on the topics covered. There are also advice and feedback hours each week, which provides students with the opportunity to ask questions outside of the classroom. The seminars are based on ?\u00c2\u0080?real life?\u00c2\u0080? organisational experiences where there is exposure to practical issues facing employment relations actors and institutions, based on case studies that requires problem-solving and decision-making, group and individual exercises; presentations, discussion, and debate.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\n1 x 500 word individual essay where the students will select an international employment relations issue and related challenges, and then use the relevant academic and practitioner-focused literatures to justify why the selected issue is important and worthy to study.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative, 100% of overall unit mark):\n\n1 x 2,000 individual report assignment whereby students will be required to write a report for theInternational Trade Union Confederationon one of their identified work-related ?\u00c2\u0080?issues?\u00c2\u0080? (e.g. child labour, climate changes, migration) (100%) [ILOs 1-3].\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan:\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\nYou will be reassessed via the same assessment task as originally undertaken for this unit but for the second submission you must choose a different employment relations issue from your first submission. Therefore this reassessment covers all learning outcomes above.\n\nReassessment:(100% of overall unit mark) 1 x 2,000 individual report assignment whereby students will be required to write a report for theInternational Trade Union Confederationon one of their identified work-related ?\u00c2\u0080?issues?\u00c2\u0080? (e.g. child labour, climate changes, migration) (must be different employment relations issue from original submission). [ILOs 1-3]\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0132).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nWorkers around the world currently face a range of issues and potential threats. This includes the role automation and AI is often predicted to play in replacing workers; inequalities based on gender, race, and class; vulnerabilities faced by migrants; and those who are overworked, such as 996 work culture in China, or those who are underemployed. This unit seeks to understand, evaluate, critique and address these issues from a range of theoretical perspectives, and investigates how work is understood by (human resource) managers, academics, policymakers and numerous other actors. It does so to inform the decisions made by those who are able to shape the future of work, and how organisations, institutions, laws and norms inform the development of new and alternative ways of doing and organising work.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nWithin the context of the MSc Human Resource Management and the Future of Work, this unit provides a valuable workplace perspective on a range of contemporary issues facing even those workers whose jobs constitute decent work. As such, students will be able to engage with some of the biggest issues facing current and future generations of managers and policymakers in relation to work.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content of the unit covers the identification of some of the key issues facing workers, both today and in the future, in capitalist societies. This includes investigation of the impact of automation and AI on work; workplace inequalities based on gender, race, and class; the issues faced by migrants; and the impact of those who are overworked, such as 996 work culture in China, or those who are underemployed because they are unable to fully utilise their skills, experience, or qualifications. The unit will explore these issues from a range of theoretical perspectives that aid analysis of how capitalism functions, and how this political economic context shapes work.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThrough studying this unit, students will have an enhanced knowledge of key workplace issues in contemporary capitalist societies, in addition to understanding the complexities involved in addressing these challenges. As a result, students will have developed their research, writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills, as well as their ability to find appropriate solutions to difficult problems.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify issues facing workers in twenty-first century capitalist societies.Propose and apply appropriate theoretical knowledge and critical understanding for the purposes of improving policy, practice and philosophies of work.Communicate ideas, analyses, results, conclusions associated with the critique of contemporary workplace issues to a range of specific audiences and demonstrate the capacity to reflect and adapt and engage in future thinking.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching is conducted through ten weekly lectures (two hours) and seminars (one hour).

There are also advice and feedback hours each week, which provides students with the opportunity to ask questions outside of the classroom.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment is comprised of a 500-word piece of writing on an issue related to one of the weekly topics covered on the unit. This provides students with the opportunity to think about their summative assessment, in terms of what workplace issue they would like to address, and to receive feedback on their suggested topic.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nAn essay discussing a work-related issue relating to one of the topics covered in the unit (2000 words), 100%, ILOs 1-3.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan:\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment will be the same: an essay discussing a work-related issue relating to one of the topics covered in the unit (2000 words), 100%, ILOs 1-3. However, students must choose a different workplace issue to the previous submission.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nAlternative forms of work and organisation surround us in our daily lives, yet we often do not recognise or acknowledge them. For example, co-operatives, charities and volunteers all require organisation and management for them to function. Equally, work practices and organisations that are considered ?\u00c2\u0080?alternative?\u00c2\u0080? in the UK are commonplace in other national contexts. To ignore the experiences and richness of these alternative forms of work and organisations is to impoverish our understanding of the world of work. The unit explores a diversity of perspectives on what counts as work, examining the significance of co-operation rather than outright competition and asking whether it is important to make a difference as part of our working lives.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn this unit, we consider HRM and the Future of Work by making a positive case for studying alternative forms of work and organisation. Students will be introduced to a variety of responses to specific problems, recognising that businesses do not exist in a vacuum, but are embedded in specific, local communities. The unit will provide students with knowledge of alternative workplaces, allowing them to develop a nuanced understanding of the different paths available when considering the future of work.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nContent is updated annually and is based on research-rich approaches to teaching. Topics will include a broad range of alternative work practices and alternative forms of organising including co-operatives, credit unions, volunteering (unpaid work) and community activism.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will have developed knowledge and understanding of alternative work and organisations. They will discover and be able to communicate the similarities, tensions and paradoxes of alternative work and organisation, based on research-rich teaching. They will develop a capacity to critically reflect on the wider socio-political context in which alternative work and organisations are situated and evaluate their importance to society.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify the key features of alternative forms of work and organisation.Describe and critically evaluate current debates and empirical research on alternative work and organising, including topics such as co-operatives, charities and volunteering.Discuss the history of alternative forms of organisations, applying this historical knowledge to critically analyse current developments in the field.Assess the tensions, similarities and paradoxes in the inter-relationships between alternative organisations, for-profit businesses and wider society, with specific reference to current socio-political and international contexts.Build teamwork, negotiation and co-operation skills to work collaboratively with others on pertinent questions on alternative work and organisation.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit will be taught through lectorials. The unit structure offers 30 contact hours in total (10 x 3-hour lectorials). The lectorials will have the principal purpose of introducing the content of the course, providing students with an opportunity to test their understanding of the key concepts and developing their analytical skills through discussions based on key readings. The classes are research-informed and will be based on current empirical research by experts in the field. A variety of teaching methods will be utilised in the lectorials, including discussions based on readings and student experiences; case study work involving analysis, problem-solving and decision-making; group and individual exercises; presentations, discussion, and debate. Lectorials will be structured around key weekly topics.\n\nThe unit structure offers 30 contact hours in total. The remaining 170 learning hours will be spent in independent study and in the preparation of assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative: A 500-word essay where students will identify an alternative form of work or organisation, then use relevant academic literature to explain why it is defined as alternative, as well as critical reflections on the advantages, limitations and broader context.?\u00c2\u0080?The formative is scheduled for early in the unit, to provide early written feedback. Verbal formative feedback (group and individual) is also delivered during scheduled classes.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nSummative:(60% of overall unit mark) 1 x 1,000-word individual essay, which will be provided in class and on Blackboard.?\u00c2\u0080?This task is scheduled for the end of the unit. Intended Learning Outcomes: 2 and 4\n\nSummative: (40% of overall unit mark) 1 group project (4-5 students in each group) including a 3,000-word group report (30% of overall mark) and a 20-minute presentation to their tutor in person or recorded with audio feedback given at a later date (10% of overall mark).?\u00c2\u0080?This task is scheduled for the middle of the unit. Intended Learning Outcomes: 1-3 and 5\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\nIndividual essay: (60% of overall unit mark) 1 x 1,000-word individual essay.?\u00c2\u0080?The reassessment essay will be on a different topic to the original essay. Intended Learning Outcomes: 2 and 4\n\nGroup project:(40% of overall unit mark) 1 x 1,000-word individual reflection on the topic of the group project.?\u00c2\u0080?Intended Learning Outcomes: 1-3 and 5\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is important because it gives students sound knowledge and deep understanding of research skills, research methodology and the ethics and politics of social research. It provides students with an understanding of research design and methods used in management research, focusing on the academic skills needed to conduct research on HRM and the Future of Work. It enables students to explore the purpose and appropriate use of a range of research methods and develop skills in the critical reading of research, the formulation of research questions and in research design. The unit is designed to equip students with knowledge of planning, identifying appropriate methods, conducting and reporting research enquiry suitable for evaluating organisational challenges and opportunities of HRM and FoW research. The unit engages students with in-class discussions, practical activities and thought-provoking, contemporary research issues that shape the relevance of academic literature and design of research studies in the field.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit fulfils the purpose of familiarising students with a variety of important research skills. These are key skills and this unit is designed to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? confidence in critical thinking and writing skills using evidence from the analysis and synthesis of diverse information gained from reviewing literature in HRM and Future of Work. The ability to communicate this evidence in a persuasive manner to diverse audiences in verbal or written formats, both individually and as a group is also important and a key feature of this unit. The unit fits into the programme of study by preparing students for the dissertation and future careers in HRM\/Future of Work that enable them to appraise research and appropriateness of methodology in reports and sources of data that leads to engaging in well-informed decision-making.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content of the unit includes developing students?\u00c2\u0080? academic skills in conducting and writing-up organisational research and enquiry skills. The unit includes: critically appraising research and synthesising knowledge across a wide range of literature; understanding research philosophy; research design; qualitative and quantitative research methods and different dimensions of quality; ethics and politics of social research; and how to craft an excellent dissertation\/applied project.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will have formed a deep understanding of research skills and the ethics and political of social research that equips them for undertaking their own projects and better decision-making in their future careers by being able to understand the methodology in data and reports presented to them. They will acquire engagement and influence skills through critical thinking and capability in communicating to different audiences. They will have better understanding of ethical tensions, dilemmas and issues in HRM\/FoW research and develop personal effectiveness through self-reflective learning and evaluation of information sources.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nILO 1 - Critically analyse a range of academic perspectives with reference to their role in the creation and use of different types of knowledge\n\nILO 2 - Discuss how context, culture and the values of the researcher, and others with an interest in the outcome of research, affect the research process and how data are gathered and used\n\nILO 3 - Make informed decisions about appropriate methodologies, commonly used methods and any particular challenges of undertaking management research in a variety of contexts.\n\nILO 4 - Appraise the ethical and practical issues arising in carrying out research and take account of these issues when developing a research proposal.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be conducted through ten lectures of 2 hours and five tutorials of 2 hours (totalling 30 hours contact time) in TB2. The lectures comprise a combination of talks, reflective activities and think tasks to engage students. Tutorials deepen student?\u00c2\u0080?s research skills through a range of practical tasks and activities for developing research design skills, group work, debates\/discussions, case studies, and constructing coherent data collection methods. The tutorials aim to facilitate deep academic conversations, follow-up on any questions arising from the lecture and provide in-depth engagement into particular research methods, especially the most commonly used methods in the HRM\/FoW research. Optional advice and feedback hour sessions for additional support are available. Students will be required to prepare for the lecture by familiarising themselves with the lecture slides and other resources provided and undertake preparation reading and activities before tutorial sessions. The discussion board on Blackboard will be used to answer questions about the unit, to support\/extend discussions facilitated in the tutorials and to strengthen peer interaction.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThere will be one main formative assessment. This will take place in the middle of the teaching term and will comprise in-class group presentations based on a journal article chosen by groups that will be critically appraised (ILO 1, 2, 3). Groups will engage in an in-class discussion to facilitate peer learning and feedback. Verbal and written instructor feedback will be given.\n\nOther forms of formative assessment will include readings, case studies, research design and task preparation before each session (ILOs 1, 2, 3 & 4).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n2,000-word individual assignment (100%): Students are required to write a research proposal. They will choose a topic they have covered on one of the other taught units on the programme and design a coherent and focused research study that builds on, extends or addresses a key topic in HRM\/FoW (ILO 3). They will be asked to explain and evaluate key literature then identify a research problem, gap and research question, (ILO 1). Once students have defined a clear research question, they should develop and justify an appropriate research philosophy, design and rigorous methodology that is appropriate to address the research question\/problem, drawing on what has been covered on the unit and evidencing their arguments appropriately with research methods resources (ILO 2 and 4). Students should also explain the key audiences for their proposed research, its limitations, researcher positionality and reflection on ethical considerations.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhere students fail the unit and are eligible to resubmit, the re-assessment weighting on the unit is the same as the original assessment. This means if the student does not pass the unit overall, then they will be reassessed with a single piece of assessment weighted at 100%, covering all learning outcomes for the unit. The re-assessment will consist of an individual research proposal of 2000 words where the student must choose a different topic and one that is sufficiently different from the original submission to devise and construct a coherent research proposal.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0135).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nIn a rapidly changing world, digital innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet platforms, algorithms, robotics, and Big Data are swiftly changing how we live and work and, in many cases, widening inequality and increasing precariousness. As digital technologies continue to evolve at an exponential rate it is critical to understand their impact on contemporary and future work practices. At the same time, work cannot be understood independently from the natural environment in which it takes place. This unit focuses on the challenges and opportunities raised by two intertwined grand challenges ?\u00c2\u0080? the rise of the digital economy and the greening of our economies ?\u00c2\u0080? and their impact on Human Resource Management and the Future of Work.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nDigital economy raises several important questions that this Unit will tackle. What new disruptive technologies are on the horizon? How will jobs change? What challenges will organisations and workers confront in the face of a climate crisis? What could the future of work look like and what could go wrong?\n\nThe overall aims of this Unit are to:\n\nUnderstand and explain the impact of the rise of the digital economy and environmental sustainability\/degradation for the future of work;Develop students?\u00c2\u0080? intellectual abilities e.g. their proficiency in problem-solving, analysis, synthesising and evaluating contemporary challenges and opportunities of the digital economy in securing a sustainable work future for all;Develop students' skills and personal effectiveness to self-reflect and think critically on their own role and capacity to act and engage in future thinking on the climate crisis with integrity, enthusiasm and empathy.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nContent is updated annually and is based on research-rich approaches to teaching. Topics will include digital labour in its many forms (gig, platform, ghost, IT professional work); intensified blurring of boundaries between work and private life; and environmental costs of digitalisation.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nUpon completion of the Unit, students will have developed knowledge and understanding of the impact of digital economy on work, life, and natural environment. They will discover and be able to communicate the impact of the rise of the digital economy and environmental sustainability\/degradation for the future of work, based on research-rich teaching. They will develop a capacity to critically reflect on how two major trends ?\u00c2\u0080? current and future environmental degradation on the one hand, and the push towards environmental sustainability on the other ?\u00c2\u0080? will define the future of work.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify contemporary research, practice and policy issues on sustainability and the digital economy and its impact on human resource management and the future of work;Appraise and evaluate the challenges and opportunities raised by the greening of our economies and increasing technological development on the world of work;Critically analyse and apply theoretical frameworks to areas such as technological development, gig work, circular economy and digital futures;Propose practical policy recommendations to ensure that digital innovation is ethical, socially responsible and inclusive;Communicate ideas associated with the sustainable work futures in the digital economy to a range of specific audiences.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe Unit will be taught through lectures and seminars. The Unit structure offers 30 contact hours in total (10 x 2-hour lectures and 10x1 hour seminars). The remaining 170 learning hours will be spent in independent study and in the preparation of assessment. The Unit will be team-taught by a range of academics in the School, with each week will be structured around key weekly topics. Lectures will have the principal purpose of introducing the content of the course, providing students with an opportunity to test their understanding of the key concepts, and developing their analytical skills through discussions based on key readings.\n\nA variety of teaching methods will be utilised in the Unit, including discussions based on readings and student experiences; case study work involving analysis, problem-solving and decision-making; group and individual exercises; presentations, discussion, and debate.\n\nThe Unit is based on active learning and is best viewed as a process of interaction between ?\u00c2\u0080?reflective practitioners?\u00c2\u0080? (students) and ?\u00c2\u0080?facilitators?\u00c2\u0080? (lecturers\/tutors). Three basic principles guide this approach:\n\nReflection enables us to take the meaning out of our experiences;Empirical data helps us to contextualise and compare our experiences;Theory enables us to understand and explain our experiences.\n\nActive learning involves a combination of teaching methods, including: sound-bite size lectures, case studies, role-play exercises and small-group work, oral and written presentations. Reading and guidance on preparation will be provided in advance of each lecture.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative: 1 x 10 minute small group class presentation on the topic of mid-term summative assessment. The formative ?\u00c2\u0080?with related verbal feedback-- is scheduled halfway through the Unit in order to prepare students for mid-term summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nSummative:(40% of overall mark) 1 x 1000-word timed in-tray exercise (individual), in which students will be asked to look through a selection of documents, identifying relevant texts and information and synthesise these into a defined position [ILOs: 1,2 and 5].\n\nSummative:(60% of overall mark) 1 x 1,500-word individual essay in which students are to demonstrate their knowledge of key debates in the field of digital economy and sustainable work futures [ILOs: 1-5].\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nIndividual essay: (40% of overall mark) 1 x 1000-word briefing paper on gig\/platform work [ILOs: 1,2 and 5].\n\nIndividual essay: (60% of overall mark) 1 x 1500-word individual essay on the chosen firm?\u00c2\u0080?s existing practices in the intersecting areas of digital labour and environmental sustainability\/degradation [ILOs: 1-5].\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe dissertation is an integral part of the Human Resource Management (HRM) and the Future of Work (FoW) MSc that enables students to engage in independent creation and execution of a research study. This unit builds upon the knowledge, intellectual and engagement skills garnered from the Researching and Communicating the World of Work unit. This requires managing the research process, designing a coherent research study and making consistent research decisions. Projects may be either empirical or library-based and may include scope for adaptation or advancement in a particular research method or field of inquiry. Students have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge, choosing from a wide variety of research issues, problems and topics related to management and organisations. Student learning is supported by regular individual and\/or small group supervision sessions with an allocated supervisor. The dissertation is primarily an individual piece of work that builds on a range of research skills and research methodology covered in the taught units and is important for managing an extended project, understanding what constitutes excellent research and useful for future careers that require assessment of data and reports.\n\nHow does this unit fit into the programme of study?\n\nThe dissertation is an extended report and substantial piece of work that is an independent study and which identifies and investigates a particular question and explores it systematically over a sustained period of time. The dissertation provides students with the opportunity to read extensively and apply research skills to a chosen area of study selected from a range of topics covered on the programme. Additionally, the unit fits into the programme by operationalising the material learnt on the taught units on substantive HRM and future of work topics as well as research methods, devising a coherent research programme and achieving a clear set of objectives.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content of the dissertation unit includes developing students?\u00c2\u0080? independent academic skills in conducting and writing-up organisational research as well as enquiry skills. The dissertation process develops involves: critically appraising research and synthesising knowledge across a wide range of literature; understanding research philosophy; research design; qualitative, quantitative research methods or library-based methods; ethical evaluation; and managing an extended project. This unit builds upon the knowledge, intellectual and engagement skills garnered from the Researching and Communicating the World of Work unit.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit:\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will have formed a deep understanding of a particular research topic, investigated in detail and have produced original research that responds to a particular research problem or research gap. The unit equips them for undertaking their own projects and better decision-making in their future careers by being able to understand the methodology in data and reports presented to them. Depending on the topic chosen, students will acquire engagement and influence skills through critical thinking and capability in communicating research to different audiences. They will have better understanding of ethical evaluation and develop personal effectiveness through self-reflective learning and evaluation of information sources.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nOn successful completion of the dissertation, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify key issues in research design and ethics;Frame a clear research question;Design a coherent research project;Identify and critically review literature relevant to the topic and central research question;Recognise appropriate research methodologies to investigate the chosen topic including research ethics process and considerations;Analyse evidence, research and data that answer the central research question;\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe dissertation unit is designed to achieve all learning outcomes through independent learning, creation and execution of a coherent research study, understanding the research process and managing a research project. The extended nature of the dissertation allows students to deepen knowledge of their chosen, focused subject area which may involve a range of activities, including: applied, inquiry-based learning, empirical data collection (for example, industry-related), and\/or a problem-based approach. Given the varied nature of a dissertation, learning will be tailored to the interests of the student. Given the focus on research methods in the programme, students will already have a wide range of research skills. Dissertation preparation sessions and advice\/feedback hours are provided to supplement and support the research methods training received on the taught units. The primary mode of learning is interactive through supervision meetings with the student?\u00c2\u0080?s allocated supervisor and is best suited to the individual, independent research being undertaken.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nTaught units in TB1 and TB2 on the programme are focused on cutting egde research methods and include formative learning in a variety of forms.

It will provide students with the opportunity to apply and enhance the knowledge and skills learned during their studies on the programme. The Applied Research Group Project will have both academic value and high relevance for practice, providing students the opportunity to use real-world data and apply theoretical understanding and critical skills in order to find original solutions to societal and industrial challenges. Under the guidance of an academic supervisor, students will work in a group of 4-6 students to provide a substantial piece of research that is theory-driven, has potential for academic originality, and addresses challenges in a specific sector or industry.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThe Applied Research Group Project is a substantial piece of work that identifies and investigates a particular question and explores it systematically over a sustained period of time. We will try to match students with projects from external business and third sector partners related to human resource management and\/or the future of work. The unit provides students with the opportunity to read extensively and apply research skills to a chosen area of study selected from a range of topics covered on the programme. Additionally, the unit fits into the programme by operationalising the material learnt on the taught units on substantive HRM and future of work topics as well as research methods, devising a coherent research programme and achieving a clear set of objectives.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content encourages students to build on the knowledge and skills acquired in the Researching Human Resource Management and the Future of Work unit and other units of the programme to develop a coherent programme of research to provide solutions to a real-world problem. The School will identify suitable project briefs which will be open to students to apply for. The organisational partners will help brief and guide the students, although students should be prepared to conduct the projects with a high degree of autonomy and self-direction. Students will work in a small group to collect and analyse data and make evidenced recommendations, presenting the resultant work to identified stakeholders in a dissertation format.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will have formed a deep understanding of a particular research topic, investigated in detail and have produced original research that responds to a particular research problem or research gap. The unit equips them for undertaking their own projects and better decision-making in their future careers by being able to understand the methodology in data and reports presented to them. Depending on the topic chosen, students will acquire engagement and influence skills through critical thinking and capability in communicating research to different audiences. They will have better understanding of ethical evaluation and develop personal effectiveness through self-reflective learning and evaluation of information sources.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify key issues in research design and ethics;Frame a clear research question;Design a coherent research project;Identify and critically review literature relevant to the topic and central research question;Recognise appropriate research methodologies to investigate the chosen topic;Analyse evidence, research and data to answer a central research question;\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit is intended to promote self-directed and collaborative group-based learning and inquiry, under guidance of\n\na project supervisor. Students will be supported in setting up their teams and ways of working, and support, guidance, and formative feedback will be provided through a series of group meetings that every group member must attend.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nTaught units in TB1 and TB2 on the programme are focused on cutting edge research methods and include formative learning in a variety of forms. This unit also builds upon the knowledge, intellectual and engagement skills garnered from the Researching Human Resource Management and the Future of Work unit. Dissertation preparation sessions and Q&A sessions on the unit handbook also supplement the unit. Academic supervisors will provide verbal feedback on draft reports.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nGROUP research proposal and project plan based on organisation?\u00c2\u0080?s brief 10% (guide 1,000 to 2,000 words) (ILO 1,2,3)\n\nGROUP project report and presentation, written and designed for the partner organisation 50% (guide 5,000 words) (ILO 4,5,7)\n\nINDIVIDUAL academic, critical and reflective account of the project, demonstrating an integration of the organisation?\u00c2\u0080?s challenge, the research approach\/project plan, findings and insights with the relevant published academic literature 40% (guide 3,000 words) (ILO 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan There are different scenarios that might entail the need for resubmission by an individual member of a group or the whole group. Each case would need to be considered by the dissertation coordinator, programme director and PGT team in collaboration, and the resubmission arrangements would be agreed by the School Exam Board. Resubmission would be decided after all components of assessment have been marked.\n\nFirst, the two group-based assessment elements ?\u00c2\u0080? the team project proposal (10%) and the team project report and presentation (50%) ?\u00c2\u0080? are both must-pass assessment components for this unit. Consequently, if deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures, these can both be retaken by the entire group if failed on the first attempt. These retakes will be identical in format to the original assignments. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nSecond, in cases where an Individual student fails the unit overall due to the quality of their individual reflective assignment (40% towards total unit mark); this assignment can be retaken when the student is deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures. This retake will be identical in format to the original assignment. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, this reassessment could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where individual participation in group work has been prevented throughout the unit or a group is unable to work together, individual students work on an alternative library-based standalone dissertation (100%; 10,000-12,000 words, including 2000 words reflective section (Learning Outcomes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0036).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes."}

It is not a course about how commercial organizations can succeed in global markets. It is a course about the basic nature of what it is any organization (big or small, public or private) does when they engage in strategy. As such, it is a course that takes you through discussions about the idea of strategy and how this idea is intimate with attempts to think and act globally.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nIn the context of the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme, this unit serves to introduce students to the two grounding concepts of ?\u00c2\u0080?strategy?\u00c2\u0080? and ?\u00c2\u0080?global?\u00c2\u0080?. It introduces students into the question of thinking and acting globally. What does it entail to think in terms of a globe and how is the global experienced? Inspired by the history and the origins of strategic thinking, but firmly grounded in the current challenges facing all organisations, the course enables students to understand how specific frames, concepts, ideas, and models in strategy have emerged from prevailing epistemological frames and technological ordering. Some of the core questions centre around:\n\nAre there different ways of thinking and acting globally? Ecology for example is a form of globalized consciousness.Is strategy intimate with global thinking, or can it become more local, regional, national?How does technology govern global strategy?Are politics as important as economics in strategic thinking and doing?\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nEach session the course will cover a distinct topic (strategy and the sea, strategy and technology, strategy and vision, strategy and speed) through which we can begin to think through what it means for an organization to think and act globally. The topics are not exhaustive or even comprehensive. In other words, there are many more ways the course could have approached the concern with strategically thinking and acting globally. What they are, however, is provocative. The intent is to question continually the prospects and feasibility for gaining and maintaining strategic oversight. More critically, the intent is to consider whether strategy should concern itself with 'seeing' or with being 'over' or 'above' things at all.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit.\n\nStudents will be able to think critically about why certain concepts and understandings prevail in strategic practice. They will become interested in how strategic practice can limit as much as expand and enhance understanding of the world and their place within it.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the unit, students will have achieved the following learning outcomes:\n\nILO1 Critically evaluate the intimacy between strategic practice and different manifestations of global awareness.ILO2 Develop and apply analytical skills to understand the distinctiveness and demands of undertaking strategic activity in a restless world.ILO3 Critically evaluate different theorizations of strategic activity in relation to global conditions.ILO4 Critically reflect on how strategy is still possible when so much of the decision- making power and processing is absorbed by technology.\n\nThe course will be structured as block teaching held over five weeks, with a further week for reflection and assignment.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe lectures will involve group case study work, set readings, recorded lectures, videos, exercises. Further, the unit requires independent study, including broader reading and desk research.\n\nThe clinic at the end of the lecture period will be a space for deliberation, queries and the like.\n\nThe group presentations will be based on a single task and question oriented around a global strategic challenge set at the end of the lecture. The students will work through library-based research, supported by the unit lead, during which time they learn to collaborate on how to compose a unified piece of work able to address different perspectives on a salient topic. They will acquire skills in teams work and presentation skills. Feedback will be given by both peers and unit lead.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week the course will run twice, so two three-hour sessions. The teaching days will be structured with a two-hour opening lecture, including an open clinic for queries. Group (of 5-6) work will follow, for one hour.\n\nAt the end of each session students will meet in plenary with group presentations and open discussion based on a question that elicits the use of concepts introduced during the lecture. Indicative concepts include: global, competition, knowledge, vision, and control. In this way students will gain a critical understanding of how to think through concepts.\n\nThe presentations will emerge from the group-based work and the lecture and clinic. Students will be encouraged to use and stretch their understanding of the conceptual framings presented in the opening two-hour lecture and clinic.\n\nMGRCM0011 will be over the first half of the semester, and MGRCM0013 over the second half. MGRCM0013 will also use the same groups. The groups will be the same through the unit.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThe final week dedicated to preparing and drafting a 2000-word written assignment (60% of the unit marks).\n\nThe individual essay draws on, develops, and synthesises the entries and the learnings from weekly group sessions and presentations. Assessment of the essay will consider analytic (ILO2) and critical (ILO1) aspects, as well as concern for how and why strategy still matters in an age when decision making is increasingly subsumed in machine-driven orders (ILO4). Throughout the essay should refer to distinct global conditions (ILO3) around which strategy might cohere.\n\nAs such, students should refer to theories and ideas concerning the global and elaborate on how strategy practice has attempted to embody and apprehend ideas of the global.\n\nThe second part of the summative assessment is an oral held at the end of the semester. This will be in collaboration with the sister unit on the program, MGRCM0013. The oral examinations will be run by the unit heads for both programs. Each group will be asked to respond to a set question based on material from the presentations they have been undertaking in both modules. Each group will be required to create a 10 min presentation for the oral. The question will be such that the group can chose to emphasize the content of one unit or the other, but they will be expected to combine learning from both units. The oral examination will be half an hour.10 mins presentation followed by 20 minutes questioning and discussion. All group members will be expected to attend and contribute.\n\nEach group will be awarded a mark for the WHOLE group. This is 40% of the mark for both units.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit overall will be re-assessed using like-for-like assessments:\n\nIf the student fails in an individual task, they are expected to resubmit a 2,000-word essay on a modified question resulting in a different reflective essay (60%).\n\nIf students fail in group tasks, they are expected to submit a 5-minute recorded audio presentation and a 1,000 word report on a modified question (40%).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0011).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs).

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe contemporary global economy is experiencing much turbulence, presenting real challenges to international business. An important aspect of the unit will be positing a ?\u00c2\u0080?holistic?\u00c2\u0080? focus to explain and critically evaluate contemporary globalisation and International Business theories through the agency of: (i) MNCs originating from different geographical jurisdictions and business systems (ii) the service economy and (iii) new platform architectures.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit, in the context of the MSc International Business and Strategy programme, serves as a core overview of the activities of international business in context. It outlines the core international business theories, bringing them alive by applying them to real world, current world events.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn the International Business Perspectives in a Turbulent World unit students will explore the many ways in which the contemporary global economy is experiencing turbulence. We will consider the core international business theories and debate the degree to which they are able to explain the impact on international businesses. The course also engages with frameworks from the social sciences to provide a holistic overview of the ways in which students can understand international business operations and the contexts in which they operate.\n\nThis unit will seek to understand the complexities of globalisation and international business in the turbulent world of the early 21st?\u00c2\u0080?century. The unit will be highly interactive and will cover issues such as globalisation; varieties of capitalism; the rise of platform capitalism; the relevance of extant International Business theories and frameworks. It will also encompass foreign market entry; the role of ?\u00c2\u0080?Western?\u00c2\u0080? and non-Western MNCs in Foreign Direct Investment and the business risks and challenges of internationalisation. In unpacking theunevengeography of internationalisation particular consideration will be paid to the global north vs global south with respect to R&D, financial MNCs, global production chains, global financial centres and the ensuing New(er) International Division of Labour.\n\nWe cover technological, ecological and other aspects of the contemporary global economy and engage with current news and events throughout the course.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit.\n\nThe unit?\u00c2\u0080?s focus on small group teaching and the team-work element provides students with the opportunity to learn from others and share their knowledge of international business systems from their own geographical jurisdictions. The unit will also provide an opportunity for students to develop their analytical and transferable skills. Students will develop their critical thinking abilities and advance their knowledge of the many different contexts in which international business takes place and how they are connected.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nBy the end of the unit a successful student will be able to:\n\nUnderstand, review and critically evaluate International Business theories and frameworks, and assess their practical application in a rapidly changing global business environment.Apply knowledge of variegated geographical business systems, the rise of the service economy and platform architectures to contemporary international business.Critically evaluate the role of Western and ?\u00c2\u0080?non?\u00c2\u0080?-Western MNCs in the internationalisation of economic activity.Analyse and synthesise international business risks, geographical challenges and failure in a turbulent global business environment.Acquire and develop analytical and transferable skills through written and oral presentations.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit combines the delivery of the relevant conceptual and empirical material to support learning (via lectures). Lectures use videos, contemporary examples etc to illustrate the theoretical concepts. Seminars are student-led, working through challenges in the course reading and discussion and debates.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nContinuous feedback will be given on individual and group work in seminars, facilitated by the reading feedback assessment; seminar discussions will focus on the subject area of the two summative assignments thus linking formative to summative.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nSeminar reading feedback form (10%),\n\nThe seminar reading feedback forms are submitted before each weekly seminar. Students will answer three questions about the reading and these responses will be used to structure the seminar by the tutor. For each weekly reading you receive 1% if it is complete. There are 9 weekly readings and you gain an extra 1% if you complete all 9. [ILOs 1, 2, 3 & 4].\n\nGroup presentation (20%)\n\nThe group presentation will focus on the key causes of disruption in a country chosen by the group members, analysing the context using relevant international business theoretical models or frameworks. The purpose of the presentation is to provide an opportunity for the students to develop their group work, analytical and transferable skills. [ILOs 1, 2 & 5].\n\nIndividual assignment, 2500 words (70%).\n\nThe individual essay is an in-depth analysis of the contemporary global economy. Students are offered a choice between two essay questions ?\u00c2\u0080? one typically focusing on a core international business theory or framework, the other on an interdisciplinary approach. [ILOS 1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit overall and are eligible for reassesment will be reassessed using like-for-like assessments:\n\nIf the weekly seminar readings have not been passed, students will write a 300 word review of a journal article from one of the weeks of the course. [ILOs 1, 2, 3 & 4]\n\nIf the group assessment has not been passed, students will record an audio presentation lasting 3 minutes on one disruption in a national economy of their selection. [ILOs 1, 2 & 5]\n\nIf the essay has not been passed, the students will write a 2,500 word essay (choosing one essay question from a choice of two). [ILOS 1, 3, 4, 5]\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0012).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit explores the global nature of the Grand Challenges ?\u00c2\u0080? ranging from resource scarcity and disrupted supply chains to heightened concerns around climate change and social justice ?\u00c2\u0080? that shape the contemporary business environment. It considers global business as being simultaneously implicated in causing these problems but also mobilised in response to them. This unit interrogates the ways in which businesses and other stakeholders frame, interpret and respond to these challenges in the international context. In doing so, it explores the dynamics of ?\u00c2\u0080?wicked?\u00c2\u0080? or seemingly intractable problems that transcend traditional boundaries of organisations, sectors, and national borders. Students are thus required to engage with potential solutions that are technologically feasible, economically viable, culturally appropriate, and socially just. Students will experience why it is so difficult for organisations to change for the better.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme, the Global Challenges' unit serves as a vital unit that enriches students understanding of global challenges. This unit will provide students with an understanding of global challenges and how businesses can mitigate the negative effects of them or become part of potential solutions. Students will dive into a managerial role of a mid-sized company that is confronted not only with a rapidly changing competitive landscape but also global challenges. As such, they have to transform their organisation, understand the multiple outcomes of their decisions, and the conflicting interests of different stakeholder groups. As such, this unit builds on other units of the programme and provides students with the opportunity of integrative approaches.\n\nCombined, this unit provides an invaluable opportunity for students to acquire actionable, real-world knowledge that significantly enhances their strategic thinking capabilities.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn the \"global challenges\" unit, students will delve into the dynamics of global challenges and the ways in which they relate to international business. Key topics include issues around climate and environmental risks, cyber risks, supply chain risks among others. Further, students will understand the role businesses play with regards to global challenges. Some of these challenges pose direct impacts on the way of doing business, others might have long-term impact on business. In general, firms aim to maintain their competitive advantage by either minimizing the effects of global challenges or by playing an active role in contributing to their resolution. By managing the transformation process of a mid-sized firm (simulation), the unit will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the practical complexities organisations face when transforming their business.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nDuring the entire module, students will manage the transformation of a business (through a significant acquisition of another business) and experience the difficulties associated with such a strategic transformation that aims to remain competitive in the presence of global challenges. As such, students will gain the capacity to understand the multiple outcomes of decisions, their decision-making behaviour, and the need of making trade-offs with many decisions. Further, students will learn how to articulate their ideas for different stakeholder groups.\n\nAs such, critical thinking will expand to include a multi-stakeholder view, encompassing investors, employee representatives, and the public. This broadened perspective will be matched by student?\u00c2\u0080?s ability to critically evaluate a diverse range of information related to strategic options regarding the management of global challenges. With this blend of knowledge and analytical skills, students will be empowered to conceive and propose actionable solutions to strategic issues that companies and other stakeholders face.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to\n\nILO1: Explore the dynamics of complex global challenges and the ways in which they relate to international business.\n\nILO2: Introduce a range of contemporary theoretical perspectives that offer insights into processes of change and transition towards more responsible global production and consumption networks.\n\nILO3: Apply these ideas to real world case studies and propose solutions to Grand Challenges that will enable international business to flourish while operating within societal and planetary limits.\n\nILO4: Develop skills in communicating ideas associated with responses to wicked problems in the international context to a range of academic and non-academic audiences.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit on Global Challenges is structured to create a student-centered experience with lectorials. The aim of the unit is to encourage active participation and critical thinking. This unit interrogates the ways in which businesses and other stakeholders frame, interpret and respond to these challenges in the international context. In doing so, it explores the dynamics of ?\u00c2\u0080?wicked?\u00c2\u0080? or seemingly intractable problems that transcend traditional boundaries of organisations, sectors, and national borders. To better understand why it is so challenging for businesses to transform and adapt to complex environmental demands and grand challenges (either to mitigate negative consequences on the business or to be part of the solution), this unit builds on a ?\u00c2\u0080?doing and making?\u00c2\u0080? philosophy.\n\nThis pedagogical approach is closely aligned with the unit's learning outcomes (ILOs 1-4). The student-centered design will facilitate peer-to-peer learning, which is essential for understanding the multiple consequences of decisions and the tensions between different stakeholder groups that force managers to make trade-offs.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach week's session has a distinct agenda, aligned with the outline provided in the unit manual. For each week, teams have to prepare short presentations that are instrumental for developing an integrative understanding of global challenges. While these presentations aren't graded, they serve a crucial role: they are team?\u00c2\u0080?s opportunity to receive targeted feedback from both peers and the instructor.\n\nThis incremental approach not only resolves immediate questions but also helps students iteratively refine their understanding and application of unit concepts. Further, students will collect their learnings in a weekly reflective learning journal, where they reflect on key issues they experience.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nIndividual Task(60%): A 2,000 words reflective essay that draws on, develops, and synthesises the entries and the learnings from the weekly reflective learning journal.\n\nThe reflective essay should refer to learnings and challenges experienced during the unit. As such, students should refer to theories and ideas concerning global challenges and elaborate on how strategy can help to mitigate associated issues but also refer to the challenges when transforming a business. The individual task refers to ILOs1-4.\n\nGroup Tasks(40%): MGRCM0011 will be over the first half of the semester, and MGRCM0013 over the second half. Once MGRCM0013 is finished, oral exams will be scheduled. Each group will be required to create a presentation on the basis of a set question that refers to the content of MGRCM0011 and MGRCM0013. The question will be such that the group can chose to emphasize the content of one unit or the other, but they will be expected to combine learning from both units. The oral examination will be half an hour: 10 mins presentation followed by 20 minutes questioning and discussion. All students will be expected to attend.\n\nThe group task refers to ILOs 1-4 with a particular focus on ILO4.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit overall will be re-assessed using like-for-like assessments:\n\nIf the student fails in an individual task, they are expected to resubmit a 2,000-word essay on a modified question resulting in a different reflective essay (60%) [ILOs 1-4].\n\nIf students fail in group tasks, they are expected to submit a 5-minute recorded audio presentation and a 1,000 word report on a. modified question (40%) [ILOs 1-4].\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0013).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes. Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit?\u00c2\u0080?s purpose is to equip programme students with the ability to develop research questions and skills around the units and issues covered in TB1 and TB2. It is also key to prepare them for the Dissertation project. It is critical for students to gain an understanding of the complete research process from identification and justification of a topic to analysis and final dissemination. The ability to produce research-informed and evidence-based knowledge is key to addressing current and emerging challenges in International Business and Strategy.\n\nThe ability to question, create, utilise and disseminate research is key in evidence-based decision-making and is necessary for both complex managerial decision-making and policy formation. This is particularly relevant within the field of International Business, where multiple types of knowledge grounded in cultural diversity should inform how graduates and organisations conduct business globally.\n\nHow does this unit fits into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit will provide students with a grounding in a range of methodologies to surface a meaningful research question grounded in perspectives within International Business and Global Strategy. This will ensure that research is high calibre, reflexive, critical and ethical and sheds new light on policy and industry challenges in the global sphere. For any organisation, the ability of managers, employees and other stakeholders to distil information and produce relevant, rigorous knowledge is critical.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nBuilding on the units studied in TB1 and drawing on those in TB2, students will have experienced a range of International Business, Strategy and contemporary topics from which to surface relevant questions to form the basis of their dissertation project. With the research process as the overarching frame, they will gain a thorough understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of conducting research in International Business and Strategy. This unit will link research methods to wider debates within the International Business and Strategy field and demonstrate the use of research in interrogating and informing business practices.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nUpon completing this unit, students will be able to critically apply methodologies, frameworks, or lenses in various contexts to co-create research questions and conduct research in a reflexive manner. Students will consider how different types of evidence and insights, history and memory, can be used to inform and address current challenges in International Business and Strategy. The skills learned in this unit will be applicable across a range of professions as students will be able to formulate quality research projects and have developed their writing and dissemination skills.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nCritically analyse the assumptions underlying a range of academic perspectives with reference to their role in the creation and use of different types of knowledge;Make informed decisions about appropriate methodologies, methods and any particular challenges of undertaking management research in an International Business and Strategy context;Demonstrate an appreciation for contextual relevance, positionality, value, ethics and culture in order to consider research questions and appropriately apply learning to create new knowledge;Synthesise disparate sources of information to frame clear, concise and appropriate research questions;Communicate ideas, analyses, results, and conclusions associated with International Business and Strategy research through effective written communication skills.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThis unit will be delivered through ten 3-hour lectorial sessions, blending 2-hour lectures and 1-hour small-group seminar activities. These sessions are designed to critically engage with research ideas, ensuring that students can develop a feasible research proposal with both academic and managerial values through the application of knowledge obtained from the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nStudents are expected to submit an essay in the form of a mini literature review on the chosen topic and research question(s) based on the gaps identified in the related literature. This supports and feeds forward into the summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nThe summative assessment consists of a 3,000-word research proposal for the International Business and Strategy Dissertation (100%) [ILOs 1-5].\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit and who are eligible will be reassessed by submitting a new 3,000-word research proposal. The research proposal topic in the re-assessment must be different from the original assessment topic (100%) [ILOs 1-5].\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nMultinational companies (MNCs) are increasingly forced to think about the (intended and\/or unintended) externalities of their cross-border activities as they experience growing pressures from consumers, NGOs, investors, and other stakeholders. In this unit, you'll delve into the intricate world of global value chains, pinpointing the opportunities and challenges that modern enterprises face, particularly in social and environmental spheres. Through real-world case studies, you'll not only identify pressing sustainability issues but also craft actionable solutions. This unit isn't about theoretical knowledge; it's a call to action. No longer can businesses exist in isolated bubbles, blind to their broader impact. As future leaders, you'll be at the forefront of navigating complex challenges that go beyond national borders and impact millions of lives.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme, the 'Sustainability in Global Value Chains' unit serves as a vital elective that enriches students understanding of sustainability, a key global challenge. This unit will provide students with a targeted focus on implementing sustainable practices in global businesses, equipping them to address issues such as human rights, forced labour, deforestation, and more. As an elective, this unit provides an invaluable opportunity for students to acquire actionable, real-world knowledge that significantly enhances their strategic thinking capabilities.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn the \"Sustainability in Global Value Chains\" unit, students will delve into the multi-layered challenges and opportunities of sustainable business practices in a global context. The curriculum is structured around essential themes, starting with an overview of global value chains and their inherent sustainability issues. Key topics include Global Value Chain theories in International Business, social upgrading and decent work, forced labour, and environmental upgrading. These will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the practical complexities multinationals face when implementing sustainable practices in international markets.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nWith this unit, students will gain the capacity to articulate specific sustainability challenges that multinational companies encounter in their global operations. students critical thinking will expand to include a multi-stakeholder view, encompassing local communities, suppliers, and NGOs. This broadened perspective will be matched by student?\u00c2\u0080?s ability to critically evaluate a diverse range of information related to sustainability and global value chains. With this blend of knowledge and analytical skills, students will be empowered to conceive and propose actionable solutions to sustainability issues that companies and other stakeholders face.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon completion of the unit, students will be able to\n\n1) Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of sustainability issues that multinational companies face when managing their global value chains\n\n2) Become proficient at describing the roles and perspectives of relevant stakeholders within these chains, including local communities, suppliers, and NGOs\n\n3) Critically evaluate various forms of information related to sustainability and global value chains\n\n4) Develop a diverse range of solutions that can be implemented by companies and other actors to address these critical challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit on Sustainability in Global Value Chains is structured to create a student-centered experience that spans over 10 weeks with a one-hour lecture and a two-hour tutorial per week. The aim of the unit is to encourage active participation and critical thinking. In each weekly session, there will be targeted presentations followed by sub-group discussions to create an interactive learning environment. This pedagogical structure is closely aligned with the unit's learning outcomes. The presentations will provide foundational knowledge to understand the complexities of sustainability in global value chains, while the discussions will enable you to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios.

These agendas guide teams in preparing slides that are instrumental in building towards your final case analysis report and presentation.\n\nEvery week, each team will present about 5 slides to other peer groups. While these presentations aren't graded, they serve a crucial role: they are team?\u00c2\u0080?s opportunity to receive targeted feedback from both peers and the instructor.\n\nThis incremental approach not only resolves immediate questions but also helps students iteratively refine their understanding and application of unit concepts. This step-by-step process is key to preparing students for the final graded assignments, ensuring that they are equipped to produce well-informed, insightful analyses.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nIndividual Task(35%): Students are required to choose one business case from the list provided. Based on the chosen case, each student will develop their own essay of approximately 1500 words that connects the sustainability report of a firm.\n\nSustainability report analysis (35%; 1500 words)\n\nGroup Tasks(65%): The structure and governance of a GVC can vary depending on the specific case, and so will the major sustainability issues. In the group assignment, students will need to analyze and present the most significant environmental and\/or social issues of a GVC of a company. The analysis can be conducted on the industry, country, product, or firm level.\n\nFinal Case analysis report (40%; 3500 words)Final Case presentation (25%; 15 minutes)\n\nThe individual task will support ILOs 1, 2, 3, and 4. The final case analysis report of group tasks will address ILOs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the final case presentation of group tasks specifically will specifically address ILOs 2 and 4.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nStudents who do not pass the unit overall will be re-assessed using like-for-like assessments:\n\nIf the student fails in an individual task, they are expected to resubmit a 1,500-word sustainability report analysis on business cases other than the one selected in their initial attempt. If students fails in group tasks, they are expected to submit a 5-minute recorded audio presentation and 1,000 word report on one noteworthy environmental or social issue of a GVC of a company.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe unit is aimed at helping students to bridge the gap between university and graduate job. It has been carefully designed to help students to make the transition from abstract theory to applied sustainability management practice. The unit uses teaching methods especially selected for their effectiveness in learning, practicing and gaining confidence in sustainability skills. The unit will centre on project-based learning, with students applying their knowledge and skills to a focal organisation working on environmental and social causes related to sustainability. This will be the starting point for students to explore the issues raised in a global context, sharing their wider experience of similar issues and enriching the experience of fellow students. Students will develop skills recognised by governing bodies, employers and academics as important in sustainability management roles across industries. These skills include scenario development, change management, stakeholder engagement, data visualisation and evidence-based decision making.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit provides students with applied sustainability practice, through learning experiences that directly support and evidence core employability skills. The optional unit complements knowledge acquired in the mandatory units which precede it in the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme, such as Global Strategy, Global Challenges and International Business Perspectives in a Turbulent World. Yet, it is a self-contained unit and does not require any pre-requisite understanding. The unit bridges the gap between sustainability theory and practice and will be of particular interest to students wanting to transition into sustainability roles or develop transferable skills.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit aims to integrate learning from earlier units and prior experience, so students become knowledgeable about the issues and challenges surrounding the practice of sustainability management today and in the future. It will develop new knowledge and skills in problem solving; data collection, analysis and visualisation; change management and decision making within the context of sustainability. The unit also extends students?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge of concepts of particular importance to sustainability management including complex or ?\u00c2\u0080?wicked?\u00c2\u0080? problems, technocratic and participatory methods of knowledge gathering and sharing, and communicating with a range of stakeholders and audiences through different communication channels.\n\nAn overview of content\n\nBy the end of the unit, students will be able to relate theory to practise and will have a broad understanding and insight into important skills for sustainability management in the private, public and third sector (charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups). Students will also be able to evidence practical experience in producing outputs such as online written articles, stakeholder maps, engagement plans, presentations and visual representations of data.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the unit students will have learned to:\n\nILO 1: Integrate concepts and ideas from previous study, knowledge and experience to critically analyse and evaluate sustainability grand challenges across different sectors (public, private and third).IOL 2: Understand and work with complexity in applying knowledge to practical sustainability management scenarios.ILO 3: Understand group processes and influence and negotiate with peers.ILO 4: Be an effective communicator by presenting analysis and arguments clearly to academic and non-academic audiences using a range of methods and channels including presentations and blog posts.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThis unit provides students with learning experiences that directly relate to the skills that developing. Learning will be delivered through a combination of lectures, seminars, games and simulations, discussion groups, practical sessions and other learning opportunities.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nThe assessment for this unit has two elements:\n\nA 15 minute group presentation and one page summary (submitted via Turnitin) where groups of approximately five students will effectively communicate their critical analysis of the global challenge they have explored, followed by a question and answer session with an academic and a non-academic expert. (ILOs 1, 3 and 4 - 50%)Five Individual reflective ?\u00c2\u0080?blog posts?\u00c2\u0080? covering set topics requiring students to apply knowledge to practical sustainability management scenarios submitted in a final individual MS Word document: 2,500 words in total five x 500 words (ILOS 1, 2 and 4 - 50%)\n\nThe group element demonstrates students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to practice skills in, verbal and visual communication and clear presentation of an argument underpinned by data. The individual element demonstrates a student?\u00c2\u0080?s ability to critically reflect on the skills they developed, the relationship between theory and practice and communicating this with a wider audience. A full explanation of both assessments will be covered in the unit content including academic and practical guidance on how to develop the group (poster presentation) and individual (blog post) assessment elements.\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nGroup presentation - There are opportunities for students to work on their group activity provided in the teaching time.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit provides you with an unparalleled platform to strengthen your knowledge and skills you have acquired on the MSc International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme. By collaborating with organisations from a variety of sectors?\u00c2\u0080?whether public, private, or non-profit?\u00c2\u0080?you will have the extraordinary opportunity to work in teams to investigate urgent global challenges facing these organisations based on the project briefs they provide, applying your academic insights to real-world issues. This immersive experience not only solidifies your understanding of complex global dynamics but also equips you with the practical expertise necessary for your future career.\n\nHow does this unit fits into your programme of study?\n\nThe \"Applied Global Challenges Project in International Business and Strategy\" unit serves as the pinnacle of your educational journey in the MSc in International Business and Strategy: Global Challenges programme. This unit is strategically positioned to empower you to integrate theory and practice, working in teams to identify and investigate a particular question related to global challenges facing organisational partners. Based on group-based extensive independent research with the help of academic supervisor, it is expected to convey final research output with both academic and non-academic audiences.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit integrates academic theories with real-world application. Students develop a research proposal based on a project brief, conduct a literature review, apply research methodologies, and create deliverables for an overseas organisational partner. Guided by an academic supervisor, the project culminates in a reflective academic account.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCompleting this unit equips students with practical know-how and a nuanced understanding of global challenges. It hones critical thinking, enabling a multi-faceted view of complex issues. Skill-wise, students gain project management expertise and learn to communicate effectively with various stakeholders, readying them for professional roles in the future career.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nFormulate a clear, central, and refined research question based on project briefs provided by organisational partners;Identify and critically review literature relevant to the topic and refined research question;Select and apply an appropriate methodology to investigate organisational partner?\u00c2\u0080?s brief and the global challenge in focus;Analyse gathered data or evidence, deriving insights that are relevant to global challenges and propose possible solutions or interventions;Demonstrate effective project management skills including teamwork, time management, and adherence to deadlines;Produce a well-written report and professional presentation for the organisational partners and associated stakeholders which conforms to the conventions of sector in which they are working;Generate an accompanying academic, critical and reflective account of the project.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe principal method of teaching is through supervision. This is carried out on an individual basis supported by small group supervision where appropriate.\n\nWhen appropriate, students will be able to participate in workshops which cover essential aspects of doing field trips in partner organisations.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEach group will be assigned an academic supervisor who will provide relevant support. Supervisors will read and give detailed feedback on a full draft of the project report, whether complete or by chapter, advising on areas that need improvement. There will also be one mock presentation during which the supervisor can offer constructive feedback. The entire supervisory process supports and feeds into the summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark\n\nTeam project written report for the partner organisation 50%  (guide 5, 000 words) (ILO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)Team project digital asynchronous presentation for the partner organisation 10% (guide 10 minutes) (ILO 5, 6)Individual academic, critical and reflective account of the project, demonstrating an integration of the organisation?\u00c2\u0080?s global challenge, the research approach\/project plan, findings and insights with the relevant published academic literature 40% (guide 4000 words) (ILO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n\nPeer assessment will form part of the marking scheme in line with each student?\u00c2\u0080?s contribution to the project and the size of their group.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThere are different scenarios that might entail the need for resubmission by an individual member of a group or the whole group. Each case would need to be considered by the dissertation coordinator, programme director and PGT team in collaboration, and the resubmission arrangements would be agreed by the School Exam Board. Resubmission would be decided after all components of assessment have been marked.\n\nFirst, the two group-based assessment elements ?\u00c2\u0080? the team project written report (50%) and the team project digital asynchronous presentation (10%) ?\u00c2\u0080? are both must-pass assessment components for this unit. Consequently, if deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures, these can both be retaken by the entire group if failed on the first attempt. These retakes will be identical in format to the original assignments. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could either entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nSecond, in cases where an individual group fails the unit overall due to the quality of their individual reflective assignment (40% towards total unit mark); this assignment can be retaken when the student is deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures. This retake will be identical in format to the original assignment. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could either entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where individual participation in group work has been prevented throughout the unit or a group is unable to work together, individual students work on an alternative library-based standalone dissertation (100%; 10,000-12,000 words, including 2000 words reflective section) (ILO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0039).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes. Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis compulsory unit is vital for your academic and professional development. During your engagement with the academic process as creators and co-creators of (situated) knowledge, you will engage with debates in the academic literature, and where appropriate, to draw on their own culturally embedded knowledge to critique extant domain-based knowledge and propose valid alternative understanding. This dissertation project can set you up for an academic career if you wish and, more importantly, for a career of lifelong learning, where you are able to engage with debates in the academic literature, and in society, from an informed and critical perspective.\n\nHow does this unit fits into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit is integral to your program, focusing on applying foundational knowledge in International Business and Strategy through an academic research project.

This hands-on experience not only deepens your understanding but also prepares you for real-world challenges in International Business.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe aim of this research project and associated dissertation is for students to undertake an individual inquiry relevant to International Business and Strategy at master?\u00c2\u0080?s level. It will give students the chance to work autonomously on a project of their choice and to demonstrate and develop communication, problem-solving, research- and project-management understanding, knowledge and skills.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will be supported by an academic supervisor whose guidance they will draw on to do the research and complete the dissertation write-up (10,000-12,000 word limit). A dissertation demands self-motivation and good organisational skills. Students are expected to show initiative in choosing their topic of study and in executing the research, with guidance and support from the Programme Director and the Research Skills for International Business and Strategy unit. The unit will further develop skills in developing a research agenda, formulating appropriate research questions, conducting a literature review, planning a research programme, analysing data, and communicating the findings by a fixed deadline.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nFrame a clear, central research question;Identify and critically review literature relevant to the topic and central research question;Understand and apply an appropriate research methodology to investigate the chosen topic;Analyse data and\/or evidence, where appropriate, and draw apposite conclusions that answer the central research question;Integrate conclusions into wider academic debates;Produce a dissertation in a clear, well-written and grammatically correct style, that conforms to the conventions of academic presentation.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThere will be five hours of supervision with an assigned dissertation supervisor. Supervisor responsibilities include guidance on aspects of the dissertation preparation (including a specific discussion on research ethics approval, where appropriate), checking and helping with formal arguments and theoretical models, data collection, analysis and conclusions as applicable.\n\nThe numbers of indicative hours are: 5 hours of supervision and 595 hours of independent study.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nEvery student will be allocated a dissertation supervisor, whose guidance they will use to do the research and complete the dissertation write-up. The student can draft chapters of the dissertation for review by their supervisor. Supervisors will read and provide feedback on one full draft of the dissertation (either complete or by chapter). Feedback should provide detail on the requirements for improvement. This supports and feeds forward into the summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nA dissertation of 10,000 to 12,000 words (100%). The dissertation will assess students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to frame a research question in the context of relevant literature, apply a suitable research strategy for either of qualitative, quantitative or library-based research study; analyse resulting data and draw relevant conclusions and integrate these into wider academic debates. The dissertation will also assess students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to produce a substantial piece of work independently and by a deadline, which also conforms to the conventions of academic presentation [ILOs 1-6].\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nIf students are eligible for a reassessment they will be required to rework their dissertation to improve the original submission or submit an equivalent piece of work (10,000-12,000 words) (100%) [ILOs 1-6].\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit introduces students to the discipline and practice of management and organisation and, as a mandatory unit, provides a foundation for further study in the field. It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs).

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nLeadership is critical for organizations. Organizations must adapt to the internal and external pressures of a dynamic global economy. To adapt, requires change, and leaders drive this process of change. Thus, this unit enhances students?\u00c2\u0080? understanding of leading change in the contemporary organisational context. Crucially, this unit will develop students?\u00c2\u0080? own approach to leadership through the connection of current theories of leadership, strategy and change, with students?\u00c2\u0080? engagement in intense active learning leadership scenarios. The unit will cover the role and purpose of leadership and diverse perspectives, frameworks and key debates concerning how different types of change can be led and managed. The unit will provide the opportunity for reflective enquiry and developing oneself as a responsible leader and global citizen and understanding and challenging your peer?\u00c2\u0080?s own leadership approaches through team-based active learning.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nAs a Capstone of the Management MSc with a focus on Leadership, Strategy and Change, the unit examines the pervasive organisational context of complexity and change in the last few decades, and the application of contemporary theories of leadership and change, in the 21st?\u00c2\u0080?century. The unit covers the role of leadership and diverse perspectives, frameworks, and key debates surrounding it, to enable Management MSc students to develop as a responsible, ethical leader and global citizen. Ultimately this unit will bring together students?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge from other finished units on the Management MSc, to feed into their own approach to leading change in active learning contexts.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nStudents will study structural, systemic, and cultural influences to understand the complex dynamics of leadership and change. They will critically evaluate various topic areas such as the politics of leading change, diversity, authority and power; leading change in teams; leadership challenges; authentic and ethical leadership, corporate social responsibility (CSR & sustainability); leading large-scale change, strategy, creativity and enterprise. The unit will make extensive use of simulations and active learning to aid students?\u00c2\u0080? consolidation of leadership theory and its practice.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nBy engaging actively in this unit, students will?\u00c2\u0080?transform into responsible leaders?\u00c2\u0080?who can?\u00c2\u0080?analyze organizational situations?\u00c2\u0080?and develop an?\u00c2\u0080?appropriate leadership style?\u00c2\u0080?to drive change. They will gain?\u00c2\u0080?familiarity with simulations and active learning strategies?\u00c2\u0080?to compare their own leadership approaches vs effective and ineffective leadership approaches. Additionally, students will cultivate?\u00c2\u0080?ethical leadership skills, learn strategies for?\u00c2\u0080?implementing organizational change, and understand the?\u00c2\u0080?role of leadership in crisis management. Lastly, experiencing leadership from diverse backgrounds and situations across cultural contexts will highlight the?\u00c2\u0080?value of different perspectives?\u00c2\u0080?in strategy and change within organizations.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of this unit, a successful student will be able to:\n\ninterpret and critically assess knowledge form the unit, and from your own readings to gain an in depth understanding of leadership, strategy and change management in the contemporary organisational context of complexity.work independently and\/or cooperate in teams to analyse, critically debate and present change leadership problems, and to develop, present, and argue potential solutions.critically apply theory and relevant empirical evidence to reach firm conclusions on desirable courses of appropriate action related to leading change in organisations.select and develop key fine-grained leadership skills and approaches that are responsible, appropriate and required by modern organisations.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nBlended learning which will include a mix of lectures and seminars supported by Blackboard e-learning\n\nContact hours 45 hours (21, hours lectures, 24 hours tutorials)\n\nThe unit involves a mix of student-centred learning, research led teaching, reflective elements, interactive content (e.g. simulation), real-life organization cases, and assessment of problems from the perspective of leadership. These elements provide a mixture of theory-based and practice-based learning to grasp organizational challenges and how leaders can address them. It also allows for development of your own leadership approach for the future. The greater emphasis on an active learning approach is reflected in the number of seminar hours. The more intensive timetabling of the sessions is conducive to this active learning approach, and will allow greater immersion in this capstone unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment will include analytical seminar group work relating to leadership and change, followed by small group presentations (ILOs 1,2,3,4). Formative feedback will be provided by a seminar leader on a regular basis. Students will also offer and receive constructive feedback from their peers.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n1) In class group presentation, questions, and supporting written proposal documents (summative group assessment ?\u00c2\u0080?30%of the total unit mark, 10 minutes max per presentation). This work will require group analysis of a leadership event. The objective of this form of assessment is to be able to relate empirical evidence and\/or working practice to the concepts and experiences discussed within the unit (ILOs 1,2,3,4).\n\n2) Essay of 3,000 words (summative individual assessment ?\u00c2\u0080?70%of the total unit mark) which will assess students?\u00c2\u0080? critical understanding of the literature and their ability to apply the concepts and theories, explored in academic literature to a real-life case of leadership (ILOs 1,2,3,4).\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\n1) Original assessment?\u00c2\u0080?Group?\u00c2\u0080?work (30% of unit weighting)?\u00c2\u0080?-?\u00c2\u0080?reassessment?\u00c2\u0080?is now anindividualposter, proportionally adjusted for one person, of the same format uploaded to Blackboard, and students must choose a different case of change to analyse from the perspective of leadership.

It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes. Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to give the MSc in Management programme students a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of Strategic Management and Finance and Accounting. These two key areas are central to the successful operation of businesses, both in the private and non-profit sector. In this unit you will explore the key aspects of what businesses do and the strategic and financial pressures managers face in deciding where and how their businesses should compete. Drawing on real world case studies you will explore how strategic and financial decisions interact with one another. It provides you with a foundational understanding of how businesses are organised, the competitive challenges they face and experience of using tools and techniques to successfully manage businesses in an increasingly uncertain and competitive world.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc Management programme this unit is crucial to your understanding of the fundamentals of business, in strategy and finance and you?\u00c2\u0080?ll build on the learning from this unit as you move through your programme.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn this unit students will explore theories, practices and complexities of strategy and finance and accounting. Students will develop a detailed understanding of each of these areas and, through joint case studies, teaching sessions and assessment, will learn how these fundamental areas of business relate to, and influence one another.\n\nThe unit curriculum is based around several key elements including, environmental analysis, platform business, resources, and capabilities, how organisations are financed, financial accounting, management accounting and performance management. Students will develop their commercial awareness and consider how knowledge is applied to different scenarios and real-world problems.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of the strategic, financial, and accounting challenges faced by organisations in a rapidly changing global environment. They will build on that understanding through the development of professional skills, for example, through groupwork, research, presentations and critical assessment and decision making. The resulting combination of knowledge and skills prepares students to work in a wide range of managerial roles and provides students with insights into organisations which they will be able to use when talking to employers.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit successful students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the theories, approaches and techniques that support organisations in their strategic and financial management.Evaluate the strategic and financial decisions and performance of organisations.Apply theories and techniques to different organisations and scenarios.Propose options for organisations to address strategic and financial aspirations and challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will attend in person lectures and seminars for the two disciplines Strategy, and Accounting and Finance. During the unit students will also attend seminars to explore and apply the interconnectedness of the two disciplines.

Additional readings, videos, exercises, and media on the Blackboard online learning environment will develop and support learning.\n\nSeminars explore, develop, and apply understanding via readings, research, exercises, and case studies. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of ways during seminars including small group discussions and presentations.\n\nCombined interactive teaching sessions take place during the unit, offering students an opportunity to draw together their knowledge and understanding of strategy, finance and accounting. Peer-to-peer learning is developed in these sessions. Students work in their assessment groups to develop their understanding of the complex issues facing organisations. During these sessions students receive detailed formative feed-back on their group assessment. This helps promote a cycle of engagement with the group assessment across several interactive teaching sessions. These joint sessions align the students?\u00c2\u0080? learning and assessment with the pedagogical content and structure of the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for your summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will attend interactive seminars at which both strategy and accounting and finance staff are present. These joint seminars are focused on drawing together the two broad areas of pedagogic knowledge and skills covered on the unit. Students work together in their assessment groups on case studies and preparing for their joint summative assessment. During these seminars students receive formative feedback on their preparation for the joint summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit (summative assessment)\n\nAssessment 1 (10% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nSeminar preparation.Seminars are a key focus of learning in this unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe role of business in modern society is rapidly changing, with a need to be accountable beyond economic gains and growth. Corporate social responsibility and sustainability are thus vital issues for society, nature, organisations, employees, managers and consumers. In this unit, students will explore the origins of CSR and sustainability and consider how businesses can respond to social and environmental breakdown to promote more sustainable futures. Students will be introduced to the latest thinking on Business Ethics, CSR and sustainability, including insights from core disciplines such as Critical Management Studies, Supply Chain Management, Organisation Theory, Ethical Theory and International Business.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis pathway unit follows an introduction to management by providing a detailed exploration of a specific area of management theory and practice of CSR and Sustainability. Topics include: sustainable production and consumption, globalisation and global value chains, ethics, regulation and governance, stakeholder management and engagement, and a critique of CSR and sustainability. In addition to theoretical engagement with these topics, students will explore practical and problem-focused case studies of sustainability management as well the social and environmental challenges that contemporary organisations and managers face.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe content of learning includes four core disciplines of Business Ethics, Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Supply Chain Management and Social Entrepreneurship, which draw upon insights from Critical Management Studies, Supply Chain Management, Organisation Theory, Ethical Theory and International Business.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nThe contact hours for this unit are 45, including 20 hours of lectures and 25 hours of seminars. Students will develop an in-depth understanding of the theories and practices that underpin CSR and Sustainability in today?\u00c2\u0080?s organisations. You will critically evaluate areas including global and social challenges to business, sustainable production and consumption, stakeholder management and engagement, business ethics and strategic management in social businesses.\n\nWe aim to guide, teach and develop analytical and confident critical thinkers. You will gain insight into the nature of management and CSR and Sustainability and will be armed with the knowledge to apply management theory to practice. Groupwork and presentations, often based on industry case studies, allow practical application of theory and develop the teamwork and communication skills expected in today'?\u00c2\u0080?s workplace.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nILO1: Explain the key concepts and principles that constitute contemporary perspectives on and approaches to CSR and sustainability\n\nILO2: Question the regulatory dynamics of CSR and how sustainability agendas are shaping firm strategy\n\nILO3: Critically evaluate and engage with existing CSR and sustainability initiatives\n\nILO4: Employ theoretical and practical knowledge to propose new solutions to the social and environmental challenges firms and organisations face in the current and future business environment.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThis unit focuses on interactive learning and research-rich learning.

The area of research will be informed by the team?\u00c2\u0080?s creation of a research proposal in the early stages of the process.\n\nThe Team Dissertation Project provides students the opportunity to read extensively and collectively apply research and interpretation skills to a chosen area of study. Projects may be either empirical or library-based and may include scope for adaptation in method or field of inquiry.\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nA capstone unit such as the Team Dissertation Project represents a fundamental component of postgraduate study at master?\u00c2\u0080?s level, presenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme and the development of students?\u00c2\u0080? research skills and other important transferrable skills.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nPresenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme to develop empirically founded theoretically informed answers or solutions to organisational or societal issues, this unit develops important research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork, time management, and collaborative learning and inquiry.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThrough this unit, students will undertake the fundamental aspects for conducting a research study: framing a clear, central research question based on a clear understanding of the context of the research and a critical review of literature relevant to the topic; choosing an appropriate research methodology including an understanding of associated ethical implications; conducting an accurate and reliable analysis and interpretation of findings in providing answers to the research question; and the effective presentation of a research report that meets required standards and protocols.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThrough this unit students gain experience in collaborative learning and inquiry through collective application, research, and interpretation, developing research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork and time management.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion, students will demonstrate ability to:\n\n1) frame a clear, central research question based on an clear understanding of the context of the research and a critical review of literature relevant to the topic\n\n2) understand and apply an appropriate research methodology and corresponding research ethics and GDPR processes and obligations to investigate the chosen topic\n\n3) analyse data and\/or evidence, where appropriate, and draw apposite conclusions that answer the central research question), integrating conclusions into wider academic debates\n\n4) produce a dissertation in a clear, well-written and grammatically correct style, that conforms to the convention of academic presentation\n\n5) Evaluate and reflect upon the completed project to identify clear learnings and recommendations for future projects\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit is intended to promote self-directed and collaborative group-based learning and inquiry, under guidance of a project supervisor. Students will be supported in setting up their teams and ways of working, and support, guidance, and formative feedback will be provided through a series of group meetings that every group member must attend.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nAlthough the expectation is that the Team Dissertation Project is primarily an independent piece of work completed by the project team, student learning is supported through a series of group meetings with the project supervisor through which guidance and formative feedback are provided.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThere are three assessment elements for this unit:\n\nTeam research proposal and project plan 10% (guide 2000 words) (Learning Outcomes 1, 2)Team project report (guide 8000 words) and a digital asynchronous presentation\/film between 5-10 mins in length summarising the project 50% (Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4)Individual academic, critical and reflective account of the project, demonstrating an integration of the significance of the research topic, the research approach\/project plan, findings, and insights with the relevant published academic literature 40% (guide 2000 words) (Learning Outcome 5)\n\nPeer assessment will form part of the marking scheme in line with each student?\u00c2\u0080?s contribution to the team project and presentation task. Marks for the team project and presentation are awarded based on the work submitted but also in light of the equity share statement completed and submitted by the group members.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThere are different scenarios that might entail the need for resubmission by an individual member of a group or the whole group. Each case would need to be considered by the dissertation coordinator, programme director and PGT team in collaboration, and the resubmission arrangements would be agreed by the School Exam Board. Resubmission would be decided after all components of assessment have been marked.\n\nFirst, the two group-based assessment elements ?\u00c2\u0080? the team project proposal (10%) and the team project report and presentation (50%) ?\u00c2\u0080? are both must-pass assessment components for this unit. Consequently, if deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures, these can both be retaken by the entire group if failed on the first attempt. These retakes will be identical in format to the original assignments. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nSecond, in cases where an Individual student fails the unit overall due to the quality of their individual reflective assignment (40% towards total unit mark); this assignment can be retaken when the student is deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures. This retake will be identical in format to the original assignment. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, this reassessment could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where individual participation in group work has been prevented throughout the unit or a group is unable to work together, individual students work on an alternative library-based standalone dissertation (100%; 10,000-12,000 words, including 2000 words reflective section (Learning Outcomes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0045).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study.

It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to give the MSc in Management programme students a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of Strategic Management and Finance and Accounting. These two key areas are central to the successful operation of businesses, both in the private and non-profit sector. In this unit you will explore the key aspects of what businesses do and the strategic and financial pressures managers face in deciding where and how their businesses should compete. Drawing on real world case studies you will explore how strategic and financial decisions interact with one another. It provides you with a foundational understanding of how businesses are organised, the competitive challenges they face and experience of using tools and techniques to successfully manage businesses in an increasingly uncertain and competitive world.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc Management programme this unit is crucial to your understanding of the fundamentals of business, in strategy and finance and you?\u00c2\u0080?ll build on the learning from this unit as you move through your programme.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn this unit students will explore theories, practices and complexities of strategy and finance and accounting. Students will develop a detailed understanding of each of these areas and, through joint case studies, teaching sessions and assessment, will learn how these fundamental areas of business relate to, and influence one another.\n\nThe unit curriculum is based around several key elements including, environmental analysis, platform business, resources, and capabilities, how organisations are financed, financial accounting, management accounting and performance management. Students will develop their commercial awareness and consider how knowledge is applied to different scenarios and real-world problems.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of the strategic, financial, and accounting challenges faced by organisations in a rapidly changing global environment. They will build on that understanding through the development of professional skills, for example, through groupwork, research, presentations and critical assessment and decision making. The resulting combination of knowledge and skills prepares students to work in a wide range of managerial roles and provides students with insights into organisations which they will be able to use when talking to employers.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit successful students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the theories, approaches and techniques that support organisations in their strategic and financial management.Evaluate the strategic and financial decisions and performance of organisations.Apply theories and techniques to different organisations and scenarios.Propose options for organisations to address strategic and financial aspirations and challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will attend in person lectures and seminars for the two disciplines Strategy, and Accounting and Finance. During the unit students will also attend seminars to explore and apply the interconnectedness of the two disciplines. Students will be guided through independent and group learning outside of the classroom.\n\nTeaching details\n\nLectures introduce theoretical concepts and ideas that inform the subject. Additional readings, videos, exercises, and media on the Blackboard online learning environment will develop and support learning.\n\nSeminars explore, develop, and apply understanding via readings, research, exercises, and case studies. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of ways during seminars including small group discussions and presentations.\n\nCombined interactive teaching sessions take place during the unit, offering students an opportunity to draw together their knowledge and understanding of strategy, finance and accounting. Peer-to-peer learning is developed in these sessions. Students work in their assessment groups to develop their understanding of the complex issues facing organisations. During these sessions students receive detailed formative feed-back on their group assessment. This helps promote a cycle of engagement with the group assessment across several interactive teaching sessions. These joint sessions align the students?\u00c2\u0080? learning and assessment with the pedagogical content and structure of the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for your summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will attend interactive seminars at which both strategy and accounting and finance staff are present. These joint seminars are focused on drawing together the two broad areas of pedagogic knowledge and skills covered on the unit. Students work together in their assessment groups on case studies and preparing for their joint summative assessment. During these seminars students receive formative feedback on their preparation for the joint summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit (summative assessment)\n\nAssessment 1 (10% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nSeminar preparation.Seminars are a key focus of learning in this unit. To ensure students are well prepared for their seminars they are required to prepare and submit, in advance of their seminars, five ?\u00c2\u0080?preparations?\u00c2\u0080? based on the seminar tasks. This will involve reading and reflecting on the set tasks.\n\nAssessment 2 (15% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nMultiple choice question. Students are required to take five multiple choice tests. These tests are linked directly to the work completed in seminars. This assessment assesses your learning across the unit.\n\nAssessment 3 (25% of final mark) (ILOs 1,2,3,4)\n\nTimed individual assessment on Finance and Accounting topics.

It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to give the MSc in Management programme students a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of Strategic Management and Finance and Accounting. These two key areas are central to the successful operation of businesses, both in the private and non-profit sector. In this unit you will explore the key aspects of what businesses do and the strategic and financial pressures managers face in deciding where and how their businesses should compete. Drawing on real world case studies you will explore how strategic and financial decisions interact with one another. It provides you with a foundational understanding of how businesses are organised, the competitive challenges they face and experience of using tools and techniques to successfully manage businesses in an increasingly uncertain and competitive world.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc Management programme this unit is crucial to your understanding of the fundamentals of business, in strategy and finance and you?\u00c2\u0080?ll build on the learning from this unit as you move through your programme.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn this unit students will explore theories, practices and complexities of strategy and finance and accounting. Students will develop a detailed understanding of each of these areas and, through joint case studies, teaching sessions and assessment, will learn how these fundamental areas of business relate to, and influence one another.\n\nThe unit curriculum is based around several key elements including, environmental analysis, platform business, resources, and capabilities, how organisations are financed, financial accounting, management accounting and performance management. Students will develop their commercial awareness and consider how knowledge is applied to different scenarios and real-world problems.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of the strategic, financial, and accounting challenges faced by organisations in a rapidly changing global environment. They will build on that understanding through the development of professional skills, for example, through groupwork, research, presentations and critical assessment and decision making. The resulting combination of knowledge and skills prepares students to work in a wide range of managerial roles and provides students with insights into organisations which they will be able to use when talking to employers.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit successful students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the theories, approaches and techniques that support organisations in their strategic and financial management.Evaluate the strategic and financial decisions and performance of organisations.Apply theories and techniques to different organisations and scenarios.Propose options for organisations to address strategic and financial aspirations and challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will attend in person lectures and seminars for the two disciplines Strategy, and Accounting and Finance. During the unit students will also attend seminars to explore and apply the interconnectedness of the two disciplines. Students will be guided through independent and group learning outside of the classroom.\n\nTeaching details\n\nLectures introduce theoretical concepts and ideas that inform the subject. Additional readings, videos, exercises, and media on the Blackboard online learning environment will develop and support learning.\n\nSeminars explore, develop, and apply understanding via readings, research, exercises, and case studies. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of ways during seminars including small group discussions and presentations.\n\nCombined interactive teaching sessions take place during the unit, offering students an opportunity to draw together their knowledge and understanding of strategy, finance and accounting. Peer-to-peer learning is developed in these sessions. Students work in their assessment groups to develop their understanding of the complex issues facing organisations. During these sessions students receive detailed formative feed-back on their group assessment. This helps promote a cycle of engagement with the group assessment across several interactive teaching sessions. These joint sessions align the students?\u00c2\u0080? learning and assessment with the pedagogical content and structure of the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for your summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will attend interactive seminars at which both strategy and accounting and finance staff are present.

It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes. Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to give the MSc in Management programme students a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of Strategic Management and Finance and Accounting. These two key areas are central to the successful operation of businesses, both in the private and non-profit sector. In this unit you will explore the key aspects of what businesses do and the strategic and financial pressures managers face in deciding where and how their businesses should compete. Drawing on real world case studies you will explore how strategic and financial decisions interact with one another. It provides you with a foundational understanding of how businesses are organised, the competitive challenges they face and experience of using tools and techniques to successfully manage businesses in an increasingly uncertain and competitive world.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc Management programme this unit is crucial to your understanding of the fundamentals of business, in strategy and finance and you?\u00c2\u0080?ll build on the learning from this unit as you move through your programme.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn this unit students will explore theories, practices and complexities of strategy and finance and accounting. Students will develop a detailed understanding of each of these areas and, through joint case studies, teaching sessions and assessment, will learn how these fundamental areas of business relate to, and influence one another.\n\nThe unit curriculum is based around several key elements including, environmental analysis, platform business, resources, and capabilities, how organisations are financed, financial accounting, management accounting and performance management. Students will develop their commercial awareness and consider how knowledge is applied to different scenarios and real-world problems.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of the strategic, financial, and accounting challenges faced by organisations in a rapidly changing global environment. They will build on that understanding through the development of professional skills, for example, through groupwork, research, presentations and critical assessment and decision making. The resulting combination of knowledge and skills prepares students to work in a wide range of managerial roles and provides students with insights into organisations which they will be able to use when talking to employers.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit successful students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the theories, approaches and techniques that support organisations in their strategic and financial management.Evaluate the strategic and financial decisions and performance of organisations.Apply theories and techniques to different organisations and scenarios.Propose options for organisations to address strategic and financial aspirations and challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will attend in person lectures and seminars for the two disciplines Strategy, and Accounting and Finance. During the unit students will also attend seminars to explore and apply the interconnectedness of the two disciplines. Students will be guided through independent and group learning outside of the classroom.\n\nTeaching details\n\nLectures introduce theoretical concepts and ideas that inform the subject. Additional readings, videos, exercises, and media on the Blackboard online learning environment will develop and support learning.\n\nSeminars explore, develop, and apply understanding via readings, research, exercises, and case studies. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of ways during seminars including small group discussions and presentations.\n\nCombined interactive teaching sessions take place during the unit, offering students an opportunity to draw together their knowledge and understanding of strategy, finance and accounting. Peer-to-peer learning is developed in these sessions. Students work in their assessment groups to develop their understanding of the complex issues facing organisations. During these sessions students receive detailed formative feed-back on their group assessment. This helps promote a cycle of engagement with the group assessment across several interactive teaching sessions. These joint sessions align the students?\u00c2\u0080? learning and assessment with the pedagogical content and structure of the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for your summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will attend interactive seminars at which both strategy and accounting and finance staff are present. These joint seminars are focused on drawing together the two broad areas of pedagogic knowledge and skills covered on the unit. Students work together in their assessment groups on case studies and preparing for their joint summative assessment. During these seminars students receive formative feedback on their preparation for the joint summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit (summative assessment)\n\nAssessment 1 (10% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nSeminar preparation.Seminars are a key focus of learning in this unit.

Projects may be either empirical or library-based and may include scope for adaptation in method or field of inquiry.\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nA capstone unit such as the Team Dissertation Project represents a fundamental component of postgraduate study at master?\u00c2\u0080?s level, presenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme and the development of students?\u00c2\u0080? research skills and other important transferrable skills.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nPresenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme to develop empirically founded theoretically informed answers or solutions to organisational or societal issues, this unit develops important research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork, time management, and collaborative learning and inquiry.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThrough this unit, students will undertake the fundamental aspects for conducting a research study: framing a clear, central research question based on a clear understanding of the context of the research and a critical review of literature relevant to the topic; choosing an appropriate research methodology including an understanding of associated ethical implications; conducting an accurate and reliable analysis and interpretation of findings in providing answers to the research question; and the effective presentation of a research report that meets required standards and protocols.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThrough this unit students gain experience in collaborative learning and inquiry through collective application, research, and interpretation, developing research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork and time management.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion, students will demonstrate ability to:\n\n1) frame a clear, central research question based on an clear understanding of the context of the research and a critical review of literature relevant to the topic\n\n2) understand and apply an appropriate research methodology and corresponding research ethics and GDPR processes and obligations to investigate the chosen topic\n\n3) analyse data and\/or evidence, where appropriate, and draw apposite conclusions that answer the central research question), integrating conclusions into wider academic debates\n\n4) produce a dissertation in a clear, well-written and grammatically correct style, that conforms to the convention of academic presentation\n\n5) Evaluate and reflect upon the completed project to identify clear learnings and recommendations for future projects\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit is intended to promote self-directed and collaborative group-based learning and inquiry, under guidance of a project supervisor. Students will be supported in setting up their teams and ways of working, and support, guidance, and formative feedback will be provided through a series of group meetings that every group member must attend.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nAlthough the expectation is that the Team Dissertation Project is primarily an independent piece of work completed by the project team, student learning is supported through a series of group meetings with the project supervisor through which guidance and formative feedback are provided.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThere are three assessment elements for this unit:\n\nTeam research proposal and project plan 10% (guide 2000 words) (Learning Outcomes 1, 2)Team project report (guide 8000 words) and a digital asynchronous presentation\/film between 5-10 mins in length summarising the project 50% (Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4)Individual academic, critical and reflective account of the project, demonstrating an integration of the significance of the research topic, the research approach\/project plan, findings, and insights with the relevant published academic literature 40% (guide 2000 words) (Learning Outcome 5)\n\nPeer assessment will form part of the marking scheme in line with each student?\u00c2\u0080?s contribution to the team project and presentation task. Marks for the team project and presentation are awarded based on the work submitted but also in light of the equity share statement completed and submitted by the group members.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThere are different scenarios that might entail the need for resubmission by an individual member of a group or the whole group. Each case would need to be considered by the dissertation coordinator, programme director and PGT team in collaboration, and the resubmission arrangements would be agreed by the School Exam Board. Resubmission would be decided after all components of assessment have been marked.\n\nFirst, the two group-based assessment elements ?\u00c2\u0080? the team project proposal (10%) and the team project report and presentation (50%) ?\u00c2\u0080? are both must-pass assessment components for this unit. Consequently, if deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures, these can both be retaken by the entire group if failed on the first attempt. These retakes will be identical in format to the original assignments. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nSecond, in cases where an Individual student fails the unit overall due to the quality of their individual reflective assignment (40% towards total unit mark); this assignment can be retaken when the student is deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures. This retake will be identical in format to the original assignment. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, this reassessment could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where individual participation in group work has been prevented throughout the unit or a group is unable to work together, individual students work on an alternative library-based standalone dissertation (100%; 10,000-12,000 words, including 2000 words reflective section (Learning Outcomes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0045).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes."}

It aims to develop understanding of management as a social science, with an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisations as contexts for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people in organisation, and how theory and discourse have shifted throughout history. Key issues such as power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management theory and practice on individuals and society.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Management and Organisation in the first teaching block of their Masters programme and it sets the scene, methodologically and theoretically, for further study in Teaching Block 2. It introduces topics that students may choose to explore in greater depth through optional units, and it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills, that feed forward into these units, and their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nManagement and Organisation is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought, dating back to the turn of the 19th century. We examine shifts in approaches to managerial control, and reflect on the socio-political contexts in which these occurred. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Management and Organisation is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and discuss key management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topics, and demonstrate an awareness of multiple perspectives and critical debates within the fieldApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also submit a short piece of written coursework that feeds directly into their summative assessment. They receive written feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are summatively assessed through a 2000 word piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management theory and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work (100%) [ILOs 1-3]. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. EFIMM0145).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to give the MSc in Management programme students a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of Strategic Management and Finance and Accounting. These two key areas are central to the successful operation of businesses, both in the private and non-profit sector. In this unit you will explore the key aspects of what businesses do and the strategic and financial pressures managers face in deciding where and how their businesses should compete. Drawing on real world case studies you will explore how strategic and financial decisions interact with one another. It provides you with a foundational understanding of how businesses are organised, the competitive challenges they face and experience of using tools and techniques to successfully manage businesses in an increasingly uncertain and competitive world.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nIn the context of the MSc Management programme this unit is crucial to your understanding of the fundamentals of business, in strategy and finance and you?\u00c2\u0080?ll build on the learning from this unit as you move through your programme.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nIn this unit students will explore theories, practices and complexities of strategy and finance and accounting. Students will develop a detailed understanding of each of these areas and, through joint case studies, teaching sessions and assessment, will learn how these fundamental areas of business relate to, and influence one another.\n\nThe unit curriculum is based around several key elements including, environmental analysis, platform business, resources, and capabilities, how organisations are financed, financial accounting, management accounting and performance management. Students will develop their commercial awareness and consider how knowledge is applied to different scenarios and real-world problems.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nStudents will gain a deep understanding of the strategic, financial, and accounting challenges faced by organisations in a rapidly changing global environment. They will build on that understanding through the development of professional skills, for example, through groupwork, research, presentations and critical assessment and decision making. The resulting combination of knowledge and skills prepares students to work in a wide range of managerial roles and provides students with insights into organisations which they will be able to use when talking to employers.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit successful students will be able to:\n\nDescribe the theories, approaches and techniques that support organisations in their strategic and financial management.Evaluate the strategic and financial decisions and performance of organisations.Apply theories and techniques to different organisations and scenarios.Propose options for organisations to address strategic and financial aspirations and challenges.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will attend in person lectures and seminars for the two disciplines Strategy, and Accounting and Finance. During the unit students will also attend seminars to explore and apply the interconnectedness of the two disciplines. Students will be guided through independent and group learning outside of the classroom.\n\nTeaching details\n\nLectures introduce theoretical concepts and ideas that inform the subject. Additional readings, videos, exercises, and media on the Blackboard online learning environment will develop and support learning.\n\nSeminars explore, develop, and apply understanding via readings, research, exercises, and case studies. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of ways during seminars including small group discussions and presentations.\n\nCombined interactive teaching sessions take place during the unit, offering students an opportunity to draw together their knowledge and understanding of strategy, finance and accounting. Peer-to-peer learning is developed in these sessions. Students work in their assessment groups to develop their understanding of the complex issues facing organisations. During these sessions students receive detailed formative feed-back on their group assessment. This helps promote a cycle of engagement with the group assessment across several interactive teaching sessions. These joint sessions align the students?\u00c2\u0080? learning and assessment with the pedagogical content and structure of the unit.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for your summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will attend interactive seminars at which both strategy and accounting and finance staff are present. These joint seminars are focused on drawing together the two broad areas of pedagogic knowledge and skills covered on the unit. Students work together in their assessment groups on case studies and preparing for their joint summative assessment. During these seminars students receive formative feedback on their preparation for the joint summative assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit (summative assessment)\n\nAssessment 1 (10% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nSeminar preparation.Seminars are a key focus of learning in this unit. To ensure students are well prepared for their seminars they are required to prepare and submit, in advance of their seminars, five ?\u00c2\u0080?preparations?\u00c2\u0080? based on the seminar tasks. This will involve reading and reflecting on the set tasks.\n\nAssessment 2 (15% of final mark) (ILOs 1&3)\n\nMultiple choice question. Students are required to take five multiple choice tests. These tests are linked directly to the work completed in seminars. This assessment assesses your learning across the unit.\n\nAssessment 3 (25% of final mark) (ILOs 1,2,3,4)\n\nTimed individual assessment on Finance and Accounting topics.

Unit Information Why is this unit important? Unit Information\n\nUnit information\n\nWorking with a range of organisational partners (commercial, third-sector, social etc) external to the School of Management, we will identify project briefs suitable for a student extended applied research project. These projects will be open to students to apply for. The organisational partners will help brief and guide the students, although students should be prepared to conduct the projects with a high degree of autonomy and self-direction.\n\nWhilst these are applied projects it is expected that they are framed within the relevant academic literature and follow academic research protocols and standards.\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe AEP represents a fundamental component of postgraduate study at master?\u00c2\u0080?s level, presenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme and the development of students?\u00c2\u0080? research skills and other important transferrable skills.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nPresenting the opportunity for the application of theoretical, conceptual, and methodological elements introduced in the programme to develop empirically founded theoretically informed answers or solutions to organisational issues, this unit develops important research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork, time management, and collaborative learning and inquiry.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThrough this unit, students will work with partner organisations to undertake the fundamental aspects for conducting a research study: framing a clear, central research question based on a clear understanding of the context of the research and a critical review of literature relevant to the topic; choosing an appropriate research methodology including an understanding of associated ethical implications; conducting an accurate and reliable analysis and interpretation of findings in providing answers to the research question; and the effective presentation of a research report, group presentation, and academic reflection.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThrough this unit students gain experience in collaborative learning and inquiry through collective application, research, and interpretation, developing research skills like critical thinking, information management, data collection and analysis, and an understanding of important issues relating to research ethics and GDPR alongside the development of other important transferrable skills in teamwork and time management.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit, students should be able to:\n\n1) develop a clear research proposal and project plan based on the brief for the organisational partner\n\n2) identify and critically review literature relevant to the brief, proposal and plan\n\n3) apply the chosen research methodology to investigate the brief;\n\n4) analyse data and\/or evidence and report findings where appropriate; develop insights or responses to the brief;\n\n5) produce a report and presentation for the organisational partner which are clear, compelling and well-written and conforms to the conventions of sector in which they are working;\n\n6) produce an accompanying academic, critical and reflective account of the project\n\n7) use skills of project management including working independently, managing time, working to deadlines\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe principal method of teaching is through supervision. This is carried out on an individual basis supported by small group supervision where appropriate.\n\nWhen appropriate, students will be able to participate in teaching workshops.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nAlthough the expectation is that the AEP is primarily an independent piece of work completed by the group, student learning is supported through a series of group meetings with the project supervisor through which guidance and formative feedback are provided.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThere are three assessment elements for this unit:\n\nGroup research proposal and project plan based on organisation?\u00c2\u0080?s brief 10% (guide 1000 to 2000 words) (ILO 1,2,3)\n\nGroup project report and presentation, written and designed for the partner organisation 50%) (guide 5000 words) (ILO 4,5,7)\n\nAn individual academic, critical and reflective account of the project, demonstrating an integration of the organisation?\u00c2\u0080?s challenge, the research approach\/project plan, findings and insights with the relevant published academic literature 40% (guide 2000 words) (ILO 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n\nPeer assessment will form part of the marking scheme in line with each student?\u00c2\u0080?s contribution to the team project and presentation task. Marks for the team project and presentation are awarded based on the work submitted but also in light of the equity share statement completed and submitted by the group members.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThere are different scenarios that might entail the need for resubmission by an individual member of a group or the whole group. Each case would need to be considered by the dissertation coordinator, programme director and PGT team in collaboration, and the resubmission arrangements would be agreed by the School Exam Board. Resubmission would be decided after all components of assessment have been marked.\n\nFirst, the two group-based assessment elements ?\u00c2\u0080? the AEP proposal (10%) and the group report and presentation (50%) ?\u00c2\u0080? are both must-pass assessment components for this unit. Consequently, if deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures, these can both be retaken by the entire group if failed on the first attempt. These retakes will be identical in format to the original assignments. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, these reassessments could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nSecond, in cases where an Individual student fails the unit overall due to the quality of their individual reflective assignment (40% towards total unit mark); this assignment can be retaken when the student is deemed eligible for reassessment by the School Exam Board in accordance with the university?\u00c2\u0080?s regulations and procedures. This retake will be identical in format to the original assignment. Depending on the nature of the failed first attempt, this reassessment could ether entail a revised version of the first submitted attempt or an entirely new piece of work.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where individual participation in group work has been prevented throughout the unit or a group is unable to work together, individual students work on an alternative library-based standalone dissertation (100%; 10,000-12,000 words, including 2000 words reflective section (Learning Outcomes, 1-7).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

The formative session provides opportunity for students to work in groups to make a presentation and deliver the presentation within a dedicated seminar post the reading week. Tutors will utilise this opportunity to provide feedback on the content, help develop linkages between learnings of the formative session to the expectations of summative presentation session. Tutors will provide further directions on areas of improvement in preparation for the summative presentation which would be some Three weeks away from the day of formative presentation. In addition, weekly in-person seminars will provide numerous opportunities for students to seek feedback from tutors on both the group as well as individual assessments so as to make better preparation towards both the components of assessment.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nSummative assessment consists of Two components: Summative 1 is a group presentation which carries 40% weight while Summative 2 is an individual report which consists of 60% weight. Both the group and individual assessment requires students to choose a digital product\/service company from the list provided in the assessment brief and work towards addressing each of the questions asked in the brief.\n\nSummative 1: Equivalent of 1500 word group coursework assignment (40%) which covers ILOs 1, 2, 4.\n\nSummative 2: 2000 word Individual Coursework Assignment (60%) which aims at addressing ILOs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nRe-assessment will consist of two components. Summative 1 requires students to deliver a pre-recorded presentation. In the case of more than 1 student to submit reassessment, such students will be put together in re-assessment groups and encouraged to contribute towards the group work in equal proportions. For instance, if there are three students for reassessment group presentation, each one will be contributing 500 words of work while working in a group. Summative 2 component will be an individual report submission. Students on re-assessment will be asked to choose a digital product\/service company that is different from the one they have chosen in their first attempt of presentation and report submissions.\n\nSummative 1: Equivalent of 1500 word individual pre-recorded presentation which covers ILOs 1, 2, 4.\n\nSummative 2: 2000 word Individual Coursework Assignment (60%) which aims at addressing ILOs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0047).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes. Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nYou will be involved in project implementation either as project delivery professionals or project review activities at one point in your career.\n\nAs accountants or finance-related professionals, you may find yourself\n\nManaging an audit engagement activities as a project managerYou may be involved as a project team member, such as a business analyst, project analyst, planner, cost controller or risk analyst.You may take the role of an internal or external project reviewer, comparing the progress of the project with the planned outcomeYou may take on the role of a client, customer, or other stakeholder with a major interest in the outcomes of a major project.\n\nWhatever your involvement in projects and project management in the future, the project management tools and techniques reviewed during the unit will benefit you. By understanding what it takes to manage projects effectively, you can help ensure they deliver their intended benefits. You will understand why projects fail and what we project management professionals can do to reduce the causes of project failures.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nProject management has been adopted by a wide range of organisations in industry, commerce, and the public sector. It is therefore a highly relevant area of study for anyone taking a degree in business, management, accounting and finance disciplines.\n\nThe purpose of projects is to deliver some new and relatively unique benefit to an organization or society.This could entail anything from designing and delivering an improved service or system, to planning and building a major infrastructure programme.Projects are hugely diverse in type and scope, but examples include everything from computer software, through new consumer products, to buildings, bridges, company mergers, an Olympic games, or a mission to Mars.Projects can also be implementing an audit engagement activity or installing ERP systems in Banks and financial institutions.\n\nSo a good understanding of projects and their management will benefit anyone whose degree course positions them for careers in product development, consultancy, marketing, innovation, operations management, public management, or strategy.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces you to the topic of project management. We provide a theoretical grounding in basic concepts, techniques, models, and analytical frameworks. You will learn to apply these to realistic cases and the management of your own projects in a rigorous, systematic, and critical way.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nBy learning basic project management theory and applying it to practice, you will develop a critical, integrated, and holistic understanding of what projects are, and how they can be managed in organisations.This will equip you with analytical tools with which to explore and explain organisational situations more generally.You will develop an appreciation for theoretical debates around complexity, uncertainty, risk, and the social aspects of project working.As part of a team that plans and delivers a simple project, you will enhance your collaboration, coordination, and communication skills.You will gain confidence and techniques for dealing with complexity and change by using processes for critical reflection, systematic learning, and agility.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:\n\nExplain and critique project management concepts and methods to demonstrate an integrated, holistic, and critical understanding of theory and practiceRecognise how projects interact with the wider managerial, strategic, political, and social environment.Critically analyse how project management techniques are applied to manage project outcomes and the challenges and practicalities of group work as a form of project organising, fostering critical thinking skills.Apply project management concepts and theories to analyse, interpret, and diagnose project situations and confidently propose improvements to project management.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nWe teach you to become conversant with the conceptual ?\u00c2\u0080?language?\u00c2\u0080? of project management to underpin the development of practical skills in analysing and managing projects. In addition to a focused, traditional lecture approach, we put weekly seminars for active learning at the heart of this unit. These focus on applying theory, problem-solving exercises, and case analysis to your group project work. Our student-centred, active, problem-based, experiential, and reflective learning is designed to promote your optimal performance in both group and individual assessments.\n\nGroup coursework assignments are designed to provide a realistic experience of project working and the development of practical project management and team working skills. Possible group assignments include (but are not limited to):\n\nan in-depth study of a project casedesign and delivery of a tangible ?\u00c2\u0080?product?\u00c2\u0080?, such as a videoparticipation in and critical reflection on a project management simulation or gamedevelopment of a project charter, plan, or business case.\n\nGroup coursework assessment: we assess both your coursework results and your performance as a project management team. Tutors act as your guide and coach to support your project work throughout the term, engaging with you both in and out of class.\n\nDeveloping your group coursework: in the early stages of your coursework, you will undertake ?\u00c2\u0080?practice?\u00c2\u0080? activities during seminars that you will build on with your team outside class to develop your projects. Many of these in-class activities contribute directly to the planning and delivery of your project. This approach also lets you deepen your understanding of the theories you apply (concepts, models, frameworks, methods).\n\nPreparing in advance for interactive seminars: we provide a clear ?\u00c2\u0080?pathway?\u00c2\u0080? of learning activities for you to follow before, during, and after each class session. These activities include engaging with short pre-recorded Mini Lectures, readings from textbooks, scholarly papers, or news media, online exercises and resources, and key group coursework tasks.\n\nThe unit uses Mini Lectures (pre-recorded) to enable you to study at your own pace and in your own time, with opportunities for reflection and interaction with other related learning activities built in.\n\nDeveloping your critical analysis of projects: as you build your foundational knowledge and confidence, our attention increasingly turns to analysing project cases and critical engagement with project management literature. This is facilitated through active, dynamic, collegial, open discussions, debates, role-plays, and other group activities during seminars.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nOptional online quizzes enable you to assess your emerging foundational knowledge. These will also prepare you for the summative assessments.During the group activities, you would receive frequent guidance and feedback on your formative task and activities. This would help you reflect on and improve your group project and report writing before you submit for summative assessment.The tutor will also provide opportunities for you to engage and reflect on your learning and receive guidance. There will also be discussion board and Q&A sessions where you can interact with the Unit Director and other students.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit marks (summative):\n\nAssessment 1 (15% of final mark) This summative test is delivered online as a timed, open-book 'mid-term' exam. It assesses students' understanding of foundational concepts and theories. (ILO 1 and some of ILO 2)\n\nAssessment 2 (40% of final mark) For this summative assessment, each student produces written work of between 1,500 and 2,000 words. (ILO 1, ILO 2, and ILO 4)\n\nAssessment 3 (45% of final mark)\n\nThis summative group assignment is enacted as a project that produces a piece of coursework ('deliverable') on a given project management topic, problem, or case situation. The 'deliverable' and the group's project management 'performance' are assessed. (ILOs 1-4)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed like-for-like, and each element must have an equivalent reassessment (ILO and % terms).\n\nReassessment 1 (15%): This reassessment is delivered online as a timed, open-book 'mid-term' exam. It assesses students' understanding of foundational concepts and theories. (ILO 1 and some of ILO 2) and will be a revised version of the original assessment.\n\nReassessment 2 (40%): This is a reassessment of the Individual coursework component. Each student produces written work of between 1,000 and 1,500 words covering ILO 1, ILO 2, and ILO 4. However, the students must produce a new piece of work in each case. Detailed guidance and a specific brief will be provided during reassessment.\n\nReassessment 3 (45%): This is a reassessment of the group coursework component. The project brief will be similar to the original group assignment, with the design and delivery of a simple project carried out individually. The student is required to produce their own new work (roughly equivalent to 1,000 and 1,500 words) covering ILO 1-4. Detailed guidance and a specific brief will be provided during reassessment.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit introduces students to the discipline and practice of management and organisational behaviour. As an elective unit it provides a foundation for further study in the field. It aims to develop understanding of management set within the discipline of organisational behaviour. As a social science elective it provides an introduction to the key concepts, thinkers and analytical frameworks in the field. Central to the unit is a view of organisational dynamics as a context for social interaction and construction, with particular emphasis on the study of people?\u00c2\u0080?s behaviour in organisations. It provides an account of some of the major theories and debates accompanying the changing structure and identity of managers and employees. It outlines the changing identity of managers and workers as the business system has evolved over time. Key issues such as management control and authority, the evolution of the management labour relationship, key theories informing definitions of identity, employee behaviour, power and control, motivation, culture, ethics, identity and sustainability (among others) are explored, with a view to developing students?\u00c2\u0080? critical awareness of the impact of management definitions of employee behaviour.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nStudents take the unit Organisational Behaviour in the second teaching block of their Masters programme and it provides a sound account of the methods and practices of management through the lens of organisational behaviour. It can provide a counterpoint to the range of existing units and inform an alternative perspective for adding insight and range in pursuit of the topics students might chose for their dissertations. In addition it provides pedagogical foundations, through the development of critical and analytical skills that can help inform their dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nOrganisational Behaviour is an introductory unit, and explores many of the key topics associated with the fields of Management, Organisational Behaviour and Organisation Studies. The unit begins by delving into the evolution and history of management thought and practice. We examine shifts in approaches to the structure of management and explore the dynamic for defining the control of labour. Recourse to the changing socio-political contexts informs the nature and direction of these changes. As the unit progresses we explore and interrogate theory and perspectives on organisational culture and cultural management, motivation, organisational politics and decision-making, as well as global challenges related to gender, racial and class inequality, business ethics and sustainability. The unit finishes by reflecting back on the topics explored, drawing out key themes, questions and debates within the field.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nCentral to the ethos of Organisational Behaviour is a commitment to introducing students not only to the mainstream, functionalist approach to management but also to critical approaches and perspectives, which problematise theory and practice emerging from the former. This reflects the diversity and complexity of the field, but it also enables students to engage more critically and reflexively with the material. We hope that students will come away from this unit with a deeper understanding of management theory and organisational behaviour ?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge that will prepare them for future careers in industry. But we also hope this will be supplemented by a more sceptical view of the impact of managerial thought on society, and the capacity to reflect deeply on the ethical implications of corporate power.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and critically evaluate management and organisation theory and concepts across a range of topicsApply management and organisational theory to real-life organisations to analyse management practice, drawing on both functionalist and critical perspectives within the fieldCritically evaluate management and organisation theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents learn through a combination of lectures and smaller group seminars, as well as independent reading and learning activities. Lectures introduce the content of the course, including vocabulary, concepts, theories, perspectives and practices. Students are exposed to both functionalist and critical perspectives on management theories and concepts, and to the conceptual tools and frameworks underpinning these approaches. Lectures include elements of discussion and debate, and the use of digital technology to ensure participation and active learning (e.g. quizzes, polling software, virtual sharing platforms).\n\nA variety of learning activities are used in small classes, including discussions based on readings and case studies, group presentations, and reflective exercises. All are intended to develop students?\u00c2\u0080? capacity to analyse and evaluate the material in an active and engaging way, and to gain skills in working as part of a group. There is an emphasis throughout on the application of academic ideas to real-life case studies, and on the consideration of both mainstream and critical approaches within the topics, which provides a firm and familiar basis for students when it comes to their summative assessment.\n\nPreparation is required for lectures and seminars, usually in the form of reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, answering questions and conducting exercises. Students are also expected to undertake considerable independent reading to develop a depth of understanding in the topic(s) they choose for summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nFormative assessment takes place continuously in seminars as students (in small groups) present their analytical work back to the seminar tutor, and to the class. This provides students with excellent opportunities for engaging with critical and constructive feedback from their peers and teachers.\n\nStudents also prepare a brief individual presentation that feeds into their summative assessment. They receive oral feedback from their seminar tutor, which enables them to build on strengths and address weaknesses in their plans for their summative assessment. This piece of work can form the basis of further discussion with their tutor in Advice and Feedback sessions (office hours).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative)\n\nStudents are assessed through a 2500 word summative piece of individual coursework, which contributes to 100% of their unit mark.\n\nThis coursework assesses students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to:\n\nDemonstrate thorough knowledge and understanding of management and organisational behaviour and debates, focusing on a key topic covered in the unit (ILO1)\n\nApply relevant academic theory to an organisation of their choice in the form of a case study analysis (ILO2)\n\nDraw on both functionalist and critical perspectives to evaluate management theory and practice and its impact on individuals and society (ILO3)\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The assessment brief is identical to the first, although students are required to select a different topic and case study, thereby producing an entirely original piece of work. Feedback from their first attempt will guide the student in addressing areas that need further work.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. MGRCM0048).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete.

Ever since, economists ?\u00c2\u0080? perhaps the ultimate cynics since they study the dismal science ?\u00c2\u0080? have tried to address this critique and reconcile the two. This is also what we will concern ourselves with in the Asset Pricing unit: we know the price of any financial asset since we can observe it in the financial markets but do not know its value. How do we make sure the price of assets is equal to its value? This is very important - wouldn?\u00c2\u0080?t you want to ensure that the price you pay for a house does not exceed its value? However, it is considerably more difficult than what it might first seem. We start with the fundamental theorem of asset pricing ?\u00c2\u0080? a simple relation stating that the price of an asset equals the present value of future cash generated by the asset ?\u00c2\u0080? decompose it in various ways and discover a surprisingly rich array of properties and insights that will allow us to get close to the answer of the question that has concerned economists for decades. This is paramount because it is the foundation for many other units in TB1 and TB2.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit covers a range of ground-breaking ideas and concepts on which modern finance is built and are essential knowledge to be able to answer important questions in finance such as valuing assets, constructing portfolios, measuring fund performance that are covered in TB1 and TB2 units such as Quantitative Methods for Finance and Investment, Investment Management and Financial Modelling. Students will learn practical applications of the financial models and ideas in Excel, a spreadsheet package that is widely used in the industry and is very versatile and helpful. The students will also learn how to critically evaluate and analyse finance material such as academic research, company information or even articles in the financial press. As such, the unit will provide them with the skills they need to be able to understand the research literature, choose the most appropriate methods for a given type of problem, and conduct straightforward economic analysis when undertaking the investigative part of their dissertations.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe Asset Pricing course provides a thorough grounding in the pricing of financial securities. The lectures start with a discussion of interest rates before moving on to bond pricing. Equity markets and determination of equity prices are treated next before the theory behind and testing procedures for informational efficiency in financial markets are discussed. Finally, derivative securities and derivatives pricing are treated in detail.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will gain confidence in both examining and analysing financial problems using insights gained throughout the course and critically evaluate statements and claims made by financial companies, press and by academics. They will also develop applied problem-solving skills, being able to break down a problem to examine the fundamental issues at its heart. They will develop industry skills in handling and analysis of financial data and will develop their analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes\n\nThis unit aims to give students the ability to derive and compare modern asset pricing paradigms, along with the ability to critically evaluate them via an understanding of the results of empirical work in the field. Having successfully completed this unit students will be able to:\n\nDerive and explain standard asset pricing theories including the CAPM and APT.Evaluate and compare the merits of these theories via an appreciation of empirical work in this area.Discuss the pricing of bonds and theories of the term structure of interest rates.Describe the basic features of various financial derivatives and derivatives markets.Employ simple absence of arbitrage techniques to price financial derivatives.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of sessions including lectures, exercise lectures, golden hours, discussion boards and other online learning resources.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment will be based on topics covered and will be made available on Blackboard. For each chapter, there will be 10 multiple-choice questions which students should aim to answer after digesting the teaching material, especially the allocated reading. Students should aim to complete each assignment within a week of its release. Students can attempt each assignment as many times as they like.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe objective of this module is to familiarize students with the banking industry and provide them with the analytical skills to critically assess banking from both a regulator?\u00c2\u0080?s perspective and a banker?\u00c2\u0080?s perspective. The unit is driven by theoretical models of banking. They help to guide the understanding of why banks exist in the first place and their role in modern economies. Moreover, students are confronted with data of the banking industry and press coverage of important events affecting the industry. Where necessary historical background for current features of banks is provided.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nMicroeconomics of Banking introduces students to the most important technical terms in banking, to initial data analysis of the banking industry and it provides the intellectual framework for why banks exist. Finally, it also categorises different types of banking. This broad and at the same time rigorous overview of the banking industry lays the foundation for the programme?\u00c2\u0080?s core units in TB2, in particular for ?\u00c2\u0080?Principles of Financial Intermediation?\u00c2\u0080? and ?\u00c2\u0080?Banking Regulation and Financial Stability?\u00c2\u0080?.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nWe cover the following topics:\n\nHow is a bank different from a real firm? What are the different types of banking? Which services do banks provide to its customers and to the economy as a whole? The role of information in banking.; What is the role of central banks? How can banks be regulated to maximize social welfare? What is the risk\/negative externality of an insolvent bank? What are recent developments?\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents learn to work with data. Students learn to work in groups. Students learn how to critically assess the banking industry and current developments therein. Students learn to present in an academic environment.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify principal features of the banking industry;Evaluate banks?\u00c2\u0080? role for different stakeholders and the economy as whole;Critically reflect on and discuss the role of the government, regulation, and government interventions into financial systems;Use the analytical tools provided by information economics to critically assess past and upcoming institutional features in the banking industry.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching takes place in a combination of lectures and tutorials. Each credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours of study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, independent learning and assessment activity.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThere is formative assessment during tutorials and exchange with the tutor.\n\nThe formative assessment takes place in the 4 remaining tutorials. Students are provided assignments ahead of the tutorial. While working on the assignments, students are in permanent exchange with each other and with the teachers. Due to the four additional assignments over the course of the unit, students receive continuous feedback on their understanding of the material and their aptitude to critically assess institutions in banking.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThis unit is assessed by group coursework 40% and exam 60%.\n\nGroup coursework (40%):Over the course of the unit, students will be given two assignments of three analytical exercises each to work on in groups. The assignments will draw on the description of institutional features of the banking industry and theory from the lectures. The objective is to enable students to use the theory introduced in lectures to apply them to the most common and latest phenomena in banking (ILO1, ILO2, ILO3 and ILO4). On each assignment, the group receives one mark which is valid for all students of the group. Sample solutions to the assignments will be made available right after the due date of the assignment. This provides students with a direct feedback about their current standing in terms of the course material as the course progresses. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity to discuss their assignments with a tutor in the tutorial which provides them with additional specific feedback. The group coursework is in the format of 10-minute presentations.\n\nExam (60%):The 2-hour exam will be similar in format to the assignments. It will be a cross section of themes covered in the assignments (ILO1, ILO2, ILO3 and ILO4). The purpose of the exam is solely to evaluate the individual student?\u00c2\u0080?s performance which is difficult to ascertain from group assignments.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThe re-sit for the group coursework is an individual coursework (1000 words) and the re-sit for the exam is an exam.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0045).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nBy its nature, finance is a quantitative discipline, and in this unit, students will learn some of the techniques required to analyse financial data, understand the academic finance literature, and solve financial problems. The econometric models presented in this unit also underpin much of the work conducted by quantitative researchers and analysts in the financial markets, and thus they represent valuable industry knowledge. The emphasis throughout the unit is on applications rather than model derivations, and students will learn how to select and implement their own models using a software package.\n\nHow does this unit fit within your programme of study?\n\nThis unit covers a range of econometric techniques that are essential knowledge to be able to empirically estimate the approaches to valuing assets and measuring fund performance that are covered concurrently in the TB1 unitAsset Pricing.Quantitative Methods for Finance and Investmentis also an important precursor for many of the optional units in TB2 includingInvestment ManagementandFinancial Modelling.Students will undertake practical applications of the statistical techniques in computer lab sessions using an econometrics package such as Stata or R. Via case studies, they will also learn how to critically evaluate the empirical work in published academic research. As such, the unit will provide them with the skills they need to be able to understand the research literature, choose the most appropriate methods for a given type of problem, and conduct valid econometric analysis when undertaking the investigative part of their dissertations.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces the econometric techniques most commonly used in finance, including multiple regression methods and time-series analysis. Students will learn how to interpret fitted empirical models from statistical and financial perspectives. They will also develop the skills to execute their own econometric models to analyse specific datasets using a software package, preparing them to get the most out of a range of optional units in TB2 and their dissertation.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will gain confidence in both analysing financial data using quantitative models and criticising the specifications estimated by academic researchers. They will also develop applied problem-solving skills, being able to select and implement the most appropriate tools to explore their data validly and address a particular problem. They will develop industry skills in handling and analysing real world data and will develop their analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nIdentify, describe and correctly categorise the different types of data sets common in finance;Critically assess various empirical methods in finance;Evaluate the limitations of such quantitative methods and their potential remedies;Critically map different datasets with adequate quantitative methods;Implement econometric models using a statistical software package;Explain the economic interpretation of empirical findings.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities including lectures, tutorials, drop-in sessions, discussion boards and other online learning opportunities.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThere will be two forms of formative assessment:\n\nPractice multiple choice questions will be posted weekly onto Blackboard with detailed feedback for each question so that students can self-assess their understanding of the material and identify points requiring further study.Students will prepare answers to questions on a journal article and discuss them in an exercise lecture. These questions are intended to help students review the material covered in the unit, and apply the theoretical knowledge in practice. They will be provided with oral feedback from the class leader and with written model solutions to the questions.\n\nIn addition, a sample exam paper will be provided on Blackboard and a revision lecture will be organised at the end of the teaching block to prepare students for the final examination.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThis unit will have two forms of summative assessment:\n\nStudents will work in groups of four to five on an empirical project that will require data manipulation, analysis, and the drafting of a report of up to 3,000 words ?\u00c2\u0080? 30% of the unit mark. This assessment covers ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4, ILO5 and ILO6.A final, unseen exam of 2 hours?\u00c2\u0080? duration ?\u00c2\u0080? 70% of the unit mark. This assessment covers ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4, and ILO6.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed within the following format:\n\nStudents failing the group project will undertake an individual project for the reassessment that will comprise approximately quarter of the work expected of the group project.The resit exam will have an identical structure to that of the first sit exam.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0032).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nAs the flagship unit of the MSc Banking, Regulation and Financial Stability, this unit builds upon the microeconomic foundations of banking and from the previous teaching block to lays the empirical foundations of financial intermediation by first asking why economies even need financial intermediaries before discussing a series of core banking themes. The unit is research-driven in nature, introduces students to seminal papers in banking, and develops their understanding of formulating and testing hypotheses.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThe unit illustrates the use of applied microeconometric techniques in the context of banking and is designed to benefit students in the choice and development of their dissertation topic. The unit develops student?\u00c2\u0080?s research skills, and it also has strong links with other core units and some electives in TB2 on the PGT offering in banking.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit covers key themes in banking. It is based on seminal academic papers on why banks exist, how banks create liquidity, the role of banks for economic growth, bank-borrower interaction, the role of international banking, how regulation affects bank behaviour, how bailouts affect structure and performance of banks, and the unit also explores fintech and the role of green finance.\n\nThe unit illustrates the use of applied microeconometric techniques in the context of banking and therefore also benefits students in the choice and development of their dissertation topic.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will be able to articulate economic arguments clearly and concisely, develop research skills that are widely transferable across economic and financial problems with a focus on the banking industry, and will be familiar with and be able to discuss core issues related to banking and financial intermediation.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of the unit, students will be able to:\n\nShowcase an understanding of pivotal timely themes from the empirical banking literature by actively engaging with core studies and demonstrating the ability to develop research ideas independently;Demonstrate the ability to appropriately deploy microeconometric techniques to answer research questions in banking;Critically evaluate and appraise current and future directions for research in banking;Apply critical independent economic thinking and demonstrate the ability to apply methodological rigour to timely research questions related to banking in the context of regulation, supervision, and risk management in financial institutions.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching takes place in a combination of lectures and smaller group workshops. The lectures will take place in a traditional lecture setting, all efforts will be made to ensure lectures are as engaging and interactive as possible with the active use of student questioning, and student participation in exercises and case studies discussed and presented in lectures.\n\nThe tutorials draw extensively on real life industry examples, articles from the FT and the Economist, and from central banks with a focus on student preparing and presenting material to their peers, in combination with Padlets. Students that do not present and sit in the audience will provide constructive feedback to the presenting students, to enable a reflection on presentation styles. This approach simulates realistic practical problems and challenges encountered in a job in a bank or central bank and allows a focus on timely challenges in the industry. Padlet responses will be discussed in a collaborative manner between the tutor and peer students. Extensive supportive material will be made available via Blackboard. Finally, a mock exam will be provided, in conjunction with a set of model answers. The assessment components evolve naturally as student learning progresses and tie in with the sequencing of the taught content as the unit progresses throughout TB2.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment takes place constantly during tutorials, with students populating Padlets and presenting research papers discussed by their peers. The formative tasks set the stage for the summative assessment components by familiarising students with core econometric techniques used in banking research papers and they also familiarise students with the structure and design of subsequent dissertations.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n30% Group assignment consisting of an empirical research project (1500 words)\n\nWorking in groups of (4-5 students), students are required to demonstrate their ability to analyse an empirical research question in the context of bank market structure and economic outcomes.\n\nLearning Outcomes assessed: ILO2\n\n70% Closed book exam (2-hour duration)\n\nStudents will be assessed on their ability to demonstrate:\n\nfamiliarity with seminal research papers and appropriate microeconometric methods used thereinability to develop and design research questions, hypotheses, and design a banking research projectability to interpret research output from regressions related to a banking research project\n\nLearning Outcomes assessed: ILO1, ILO3, ILO4\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed as follows:\n\nFor individuals that fail a group assignment, an individual assignment will be made available containing an empirical task, similar in spirit to the initial empirical assignment but with an adjusted, i.e., reduced workload that matches the load for an individual. This individual assignment will focus on a different theme but reflect identical learning outcomes as the initial group assignment. The tutor\/unit convenor will support the individual and offer guidance through the assessment.For the closed book exam, a resit exam, identical in format, although with different questions on different themes covered during lectures and tutorials will be set. This also ensures all learning objectives are achieved.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0037).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe dissertation is?\u00c2\u0080?a significant component of the MSc Banking, Regulation and Financial Stability programme.?\u00c2\u0080? Students will?\u00c2\u0080?identify and analyse a particular research question in the field of banking. This process is an opportunity for students to investigate an original problem, collect and process relevant financial data,?\u00c2\u0080?conduct a thorough analysis, and?\u00c2\u0080?form well-founded conclusions. The multi-faceted assessment includes coursework on research methods, a dissertation proposal that outlines the research trajectory, and the final dissertation project.\n\nThe unit comprises two distinct components, with the second building on the first: research methods in TB2, followed by the dissertation project in TB3. The research methods component introduces empirical techniques which will equip students with the skills necessary to critically evaluate the academic literature and produce original research for the dissertation project. Student learning is supported by lectures and computer tutorials.\n\nThe dissertation is an extended report of an independent study that identifies and investigates a particular question and explores it systematically over a sustained period of time. The dissertation provides students with the opportunity to read extensively and apply research skills to a chosen area of study selected from a range of projects. Student learning is supported by regular individual and\/or small group supervision sessions.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe dissertation unit will be a culmination of the main concepts and ideas encountered in the course, applied to a specific project which will be chosen by the student. The objective of the dissertation project is to gain expertise on a specific topic and to get to the frontier of research on this topic.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe dissertation unit of the MSc Banking, Regulation and Financial Stability programme consists of three components. It begins with foundational lectures on literature review, academic sources, and academic integrity in TB1. Subsequently, in TB2, students are prepared with econometric tools and techniques in the research method component, which are tailored to the dissertation's broad themes. The dissertation is furnished under guided supervision by an assigned supervisor who provides students with a dissertation outline for a given theme and background reading from the academic literature to enable students to start their dissertation project. During the process of completing the dissertation in TB3, frequent interaction that is fully in line with the standards in the school with the assigned supervisor allows for timely and constructive feedback to ensure to continue building on the material from TB1 and TB2 in the context of a dissertation project.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThis unit will enable students to work independently on a given topic in banking. To this end, students will learn to assess and critically appraise the existing literature in the field and to reflect on their project's alignment with this literature. They will also develop the ability to relate theories in financial intermediation to empirical patterns in banking data, employing microeconometric techniques for data analysis. Consequently, upon completion, students will have skills in handling, collecting, and collating empirical data, drawing inferences and conclusions from it, and refining their academic writing style\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of the dissertation, students will demonstrate ability to:\n\nFrame a clear, central research question within the project topic chosen;Identify and critically review literature relevant to the topic and central research question;Understand and apply an appropriate research methodology to investigate the chosen topic;Analyse data and\/or evidence, where appropriate, and draw apposite conclusions that answer the central research question;Integrate conclusions into wider academic debates;Produce a dissertation in a clear, well-written and grammatically-correct style, that conforms to the conventions of academic presentation;Use skills of project management including working independently, managing time, working to deadlines.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nAcross TB1 and TB2, lectures and seminars will prepare students for independently conducting empirical research in finance.

Students selecting this unit should have basic\/introductory knowledge in statistics and\/or econometrics.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe aim of this unit is to teach basic time series methods in the context of real-world empirical problems. The first part of the course concentrates on univariate time series models which are required for the study of more advanced time series techniques that are taught in the second part of the course. Although several key theoretical concepts are introduced, the emphasis is on applying these econometric techniques to real-world forecasting problems in economics, finance and management.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different because of the unit?\n\nThe students will get an understanding of basic time series techniques, which are commonly used in economics and finance. The unit will enable students to use these techniques in their dissertation and to have a general understanding of published forecasting results.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course a successful student will be able to:\n\ninterpret and analyse fundamental ideas in time series such as autocorrelation, stationarity, Box-Jenkins methodology, unit root tests and conditional heteroskedasticity;estimate time series models and use them to make forecasts;to be proficient in the application of different forecasting methodologies in order to use them in their future academic or professional career;apply the relevant statistical\/econometrics computer package to estimate forecasting models in the context of real-world economic problems.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions such as face-to face for large and small groups, online learning resources and interactive learning activities. Some classes will be held in computer labs in which students will be given data sets and structured problem-solving exercises to gain ?\u00c2\u0080?hands-on?\u00c2\u0080? practice in using the relevant statistical package: students will complete these exercises in their own time.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThe students will be asked to read an academic article and write a 1000-word essay based on their reading. This assignment is designed to examine the student?\u00c2\u0080?s ability to work with the concepts and techniques introduced in the course (ILO 1). In addition, five computer exercises will be covered during the term, which will enable students to apply the time series techniques to answer real-world empirical questions (ILOs 2 & 3) and to develop expertise in using the relevant statistical\/econometrics computer package (ILO 4).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nCoursework (100%) in two parts, consisting of a 1000-word essay, and questions relating to a dataset to estimate several models.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nMany important questions ask ?\u00c2\u0080?What is the causal effect of X on Y??\u00c2\u0080?. For instance:\n\nWhat is the effect of unemployment benefits on labour supply?\n\nWhat is the effect of school closures on COVID-19 cases?\n\nWhat is the effect of female education on fertility?\n\nWhat is the effect of the death penalty on crime?\n\nWhat is the effect of a financial regulation on firm performance?\n\nThe key challenge in answering these questions is to ensure that estimates of the effect of X on Y can genuinely be interpreted as causal (rather than just a correlation). If not, then public or private decisions based on these estimates will not have the expected results.\n\nThis unit covers the methods most commonly used by applied economists to obtain causal estimates, which are often called ?\u00c2\u0080?treatment?\u00c2\u0080? or ?\u00c2\u0080?programme?\u00c2\u0080? evaluation methods.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit will equip students to apply the principles taught in the core programme units to real-life situations where causal estimates are needed. To do so, it will provide a formal presentation of the methods covered but will focus on the application of these methods to real-life examples.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis course will look at a number of econometric approaches to programme evaluation, including social experiments and ?\u00c2\u0080?natural experiments?\u00c2\u0080? (difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, propensity score matching and regression discontinuity design). We will look at the usefulness and limitations of alternative methods in the context of a number of applications, including the minimum wage, welfare-to-work policies and estimating returns to education.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will have a rigorous understanding of the intuition, principles, and requirements for the methods covered to be valid in real-life situations. They will be trained to identify which methods can be used to evaluate causal effects in a variety of applications, and to assess their pros and cons. They will be able to select the approach to be used in real-life situations and to assess the reliability of the resulting estimates.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit, successful students will be able to:\n\nAssess a range of issues in the evaluation of public policies (which also apply to many other situations where one is interested in estimating causal effects)Apply creatively and independently the methods covered to real-life examplesCritically assess the reliability of estimates of causal effects obtained using the methods covered\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe unit comprises a combination of asynchronous and synchronous lectures, workshops, and exercise classes.\n\nA set of asynchronous lectures covering each of the evaluation methods (to meet learning outcome 1).Workshops to cover targeted aspects of the material covered in the asynchronous lectures (to meet learning outcome 1).Exercise classes in which we go through real-world application exercises similar to what is to be expected during the exam and PC labs to get hands-on practice (to meet learning outcomes 2 and 3).Student group presentations workshop(s) (to meet learning outcomes 2, and 3).Revision Q&A workshop during revision week. This helps students assess how well they have met the unit?\u00c2\u0080?s learning outcomes ahead of the examination and what they need to focus on in preparation for this examination.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThere are three key components to formative assessment:\n\nMultiple choice questions inserted in the lecture videos to give you feedback on your understanding in real-timeGroup presentations on your own original coursework topic. You will receive oral and written feedback on this group work to help you when writing-up your individual summative coursework. This typically takes place before the Spring holiday.Oral and written feedback on answers to previous exam questions to prepare students for the final examination (around revision week).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n2,500-word individual coursework (60% of final mark). The assignment is to design, implement, and discuss your own policy evaluation using one of the methods covered in the units (other than randomized controlled trials). The first stage is formative and done in groups (four to five people). Each group chooses a policy or ?\u00c2\u0080?treatment?\u00c2\u0080? and an evaluation approach and then gives a 15-minute presentation to the class to explain what policy they are planning to evaluate, how they will carry out their evaluation and what some of the strengths and limitations are with their approach. Each group receives oral and written feedback to then be used by students to produce an individual 2,500-word piece of coursework.Written 1-hour exam (40% of final mark).\n\nLearning objectives 1, 2, and 3 are assessed through both pieces of summative assessment. The coursework focuses on depth and the exam ensures breadth across the evaluation approaches covered in the unit.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nDepending on which parts need to be re-assessed, re-assessment will take the form of a 2,500-word coursework and\/or a written 1-hour exam.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ECONM0040).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is going to give the students an introduction to both qualitative and quantitative research methods that will be crucial to understand and evaluate the problems the students will be faced with in the rest of their units in the programme.\n\nFor what concerns qualitative methods, this unit aims to introduce the knowledge and skills required for the undertaking of qualitative research in accounting and finance, including philosophical, practical and ethical issues. It also aims to introduce qualitative research methods and discusses techniques for analysing and drawing sound inferences from qualitative research.\n\nFor what concerns quantitative methods, students will learn some of the techniques required to analyse financial data, understand the academic finance literature, and solve financial problems. The econometric models presented in this unit also underpin much of the work conducted by quantitative researchers and analysts in the financial markets, and thus they represent valuable industry knowledge.\n\nThis unit will enable students to gain the ability to critically read and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative academic research in accounting and finance. There is a focus on application and the students will learn how to put in practice the knowledge that they acquire during the lectures.\n\nHow does this unit fit within your programme of study?\n\nThis unit covers a range of qualitative and quantitative techniques that are essential knowledge to be able to critically read and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative research. This unit is essential to all the other units in the programme as well as the dissertation. For the qualitative part, the students will be exposed to case studies that will enable the students to understand and evaluate the empirical work in published academic papers. For the quantitative part, students will undertake practical applications of the statistical techniques in computer lab sessions using an econometrics package such as Stata. As such, the unit will provide them with the skills they need to be able to understand the research literature, choose the most appropriate methods for a given type of problem, and conduct valid analysis when undertaking the investigative part of their dissertations.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit begins by introducing the different qualitative research methodologies and methods commonly used in the accounting and finance academic literature. In so doing, it considers the philosophical and ethical issues in qualitative research. Furthermore, the unit considers how qualitative methods can address specific accounting and finance research questions.\n\nThen, the unit proceeds with the illustration of the econometric techniques most commonly used in accounting and finance, including multiple regression methods. Students will learn how to interpret fitted empirical models from statistical and financial perspectives. They will also develop the skills to execute their own econometric models to analyse specific datasets using a software package.\n\nThe unit will prepare students to be able to tackle a wide range of topics in accounting and finance using either a qualitative or a quantitative approach. This will enable them to get the most out of a range of optional units in TB2 and their dissertation.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will gain confidence in both analysing empirical research that employs both quantitative and qualitative techniques and criticising the assumptions stated by academic researchers. They will also develop applied problem-solving skills, being able to select and implement the most appropriate tools to explore their data validly and address a particular problem. More broadly, this unit will foster students?\u00c2\u0080? critical thinking and analytical problem solving.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nDescribe and explain different qualitative and quantitative research methodologies and methods;Evaluate the limitations of such quantitative and qualitative methods and their potential remedies;Explain the economic, social and philosophical interpretation of empirical findings;Implement techniques using an appropriate software package;Develop practical skills in undertaking qualitative and quantitative research;Critically discuss ethical issues in research\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous activities including lectures, tutorials, drop-in sessions, discussion boards and other online learning opportunities. A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques that are essential knowledge to be able to critically read and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative research will be presented in the lectures. In the tutorials, cutting edge research as well as some classics will be discussed. For the qualitative part, these will include case studies that will enable the students to understand and evaluate the empirical work in published academic papers. For the quantitative part, students will undertake practical applications of the statistical techniques in computer lab sessions using an econometrics package such as Stata. Overall, the lectures will provide important technical skills as well as a broad overview of research questions and approaches that will then be applied in more student-centred, interactive sessions in the tutorials. This will help the students develop critical thinking and rigorous analytic skills that are crucial for their dissertation and, beyond the course, highly valued in heavily analytical accounting and finance jobs.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nThere will formative assessment that will consist of case studies and self-assessed practice questions.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThis unit will have two forms of summative assessment:\n\nThe qualitative component will be assessed by means of an individual piece of coursework that will count for 50% of the unit mark. This assessment covers ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4, ILO5, ILO6. The coursework will take the form of written comment (2,500 words) on a research article or to answer a theoretical question chosen by the lecturer.The quantitative component will be assessed by means of a written exam of 2 hours?\u00c2\u0080? duration ?\u00c2\u0080? 50% of the unit mark. The student will be asked to answer questions related to the interpretation of econometric models, their potential limitations, specification and data problems, etc. This assessment covers ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4, ILO5, ILO6.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis. The resit exam will have an identical structure to that of the first sit exam, the individual coursework will be a new submission.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0017).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe dissertation is?\u00c2\u0080?a significant component of the MSc Accounting and Finance programme.?\u00c2\u0080?Under the mentorship of a faculty member, students will?\u00c2\u0080?identify and analyse a research question within the field of accounting and\/or finance. This process is an opportunity for students to investigate an original problem, collect and process relevant financial data,?\u00c2\u0080?conduct a thorough analysis, and?\u00c2\u0080?form well-founded conclusions. The multi-faceted assessment includes coursework on research methods, a dissertation proposal that outlines their research trajectory, and the final dissertation project.\n\nThe unit mainly comprises two distinct components with the second component building on the first: research methods in TB2 and the dissertation project in TB3. The research methods component introduces techniques which will equip students with the skills necessary to critically evaluate the academic literature and produce original research for the dissertation report. Student learning is supported by lectures and exercise lectures\/tutorials.\n\nThe dissertation is an extended report of an independent study that identifies and investigates a particular question and explores it systematically over a sustained period of time. The dissertation provides students with the opportunity to read extensively and apply research skills to a chosen area of study selected from a range of projects. Student learning is supported by regular individual and\/or small group supervision sessions, although the expectation is that the dissertation is primarily an individual piece of work.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe dissertation unit will be a culmination of the main concepts and ideas encountered in the course, applied to a specific project which will be chosen by the student. The objective of the dissertation project is to gain expertise on a specific topic and to get to the frontier of research on this topic.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe dissertation unit in the MSc Accounting and Finance programme is a structured, three-part journey. In TB1, the journey begins with foundational lectures on literature review, academic sources, and academic integrity. TB2 advances this journey, offering training on research methodologies. Here, students choose their path between 'quantitative' and 'qualitative' research streams, delving deeper into their chosen area through a series of targeted lectures and exercise lectures\/tutorials. In TB3, with the guidance of an allocated dissertation supervisor, students develop a research proposal before embarking on their final dissertation project.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nThe dissertation unit will enable students to produce and critically appraise qualitative and quantitative research in accounting and finance. They will build an understanding of the challenges surrounding research projects, including data collection, identifying the relevant academic literature and writing up a report in academic style.\n\nPost completion of this unit, students will gain an understanding of the complexities inherent in research projects, from data collection to academic writing.

In their reports, students will present a plan for a qualitative research project on an Accounting or Finance topic of their choice structured around four main sections: broad project topic and approach; proposed empirical context for the study; main elements of the fieldwork strategy; and limitations and biases. ILO3 and ILO4.\n\nFor students taking quantitative research methods ?\u00c2\u0080? individual coursework assessment (2,000 words). The individual coursework assessment comprises a mix of numerical analysis and essay-type responses, challenging students to demonstrate their proficiency in both quantitative reasoning and effective communication. Central to this coursework is the use of STATA for coding, a vital tool in modern financial analysis. ILO3 and ILO4.\n\n2. The Dissertation Proposal, (worth 10% of the final dissertation mark), comprises a written component and a 10-minute in-person presentation. For the written component, students are expected to prepare a 1000-word proposal on their chosen topic, which may include a survey of the literature and outline future research steps. The presentation provides an opportunity for students to share their ideas with their allocated supervisor and a small group of peers who have chosen a similar topic. If a student has exceptional circumstances that mean they are unable to do a presentation, an alternative assessment will be arranged. Covering, ILO1, ILO2, ILO3 and ILO7.\n\n3.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nStudents learn what the role of information in capital markets is. In particular, the unit aims to provide a critical examination of the role of accounting information in capital markets and to focus on the theoretical and empirical evidence on how accounting information impacts and is used in investment decisions. In addition, the module examines how accounting can resolve information asymmetries between capital providers and management, thus addressing the stewardship and contracting roles of accounting information.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit follows on from all the TB1 units showing students how knowledge on financial reporting and methods of financing, and understanding of methodologies, is brought together to assess the role of accounting information, for decision making for capital providers and for contracting purposes. The unit also complement and works well with TB2 optional units that focus on sustainability reporting and all aspects of corporate finance and portfolio management.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit covers a range of theories underpinning financial accounting and covers a range of empirical problems within the role of accounting as a source of information for decision making as well as the stewardship role of accounting. The empirical topics are focused within the market-based accounting stream of research and cover: decision usefulness of accounting information, value relevance of accounting information, the measurement approach to decision usefulness, contracting approach to decision usefulness, analysis of conflict between different group of stakeholders and their needs for accounting information, executive compensation, and financial reporting standard setting process.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents gain theoretical and empirical knowledge that enables them to understand, analyse and critically assess past and current situation in the capital markets as well as build predictions in the context of academic research and practice. As such students increase their knowledge and intellectual abilities. The analytical skills and ability to critically evaluate forms part of transferable skills that allows them to apply in the context of accounting and capital markets at in other units and when pursing work towards MSc dissertation at university and then use the knowledge, skills and abilities in practice beyond the university degree. Engagement encouraged during contact hours supports improvement of effective communication skills and collaboration helping students become confident, resilient, and self-aware individuals. Work that students are expected to prepare as part of the formative assessment and summative assessment helps them gain self-motivation and become responsible for their tasks and jobs.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nRecognise the value of accounting information through a capital market lens.Ability to explain, summarise, discuss, recognize, report and review the importance of accounting information in the broader industrial and economic context.Ability to explain, summarise, discuss, recognize, report and review how financial statements are used in contracts between capital providers and managers.Critically evaluate the potential conflicts that can arise between the contracting and valuation roles of accounting information.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\n20 hours of lectures ?\u00c2\u0080? provide theoretical and empirical foundations of each topic\n\n5 hours small group classes (tutorials) ?\u00c2\u0080? supports learning topics introduced during lectures and allows for focused work that leads to gaining knowledge and skills necessary for summative assessment. See previous section for more detail.\n\nThe work assigned and the learning approach used offers authenticity, is progressive and inclusive. Theoretical concepts are applied to real-world scenarios with a focus on research papers addressing relevant issues. This approach ensures practical application, using real-world examples. The learnings process starts from gaining knowledge of theoretical concepts and then linking it to real life examples and further to application to large data that links theory with empirical work that leads to inferences about real world problems. The transferability of acquired skills to diverse problem-solving scenarios, particularly those involving extensive data, is emphasized. The assigned work has an individual approach before classes and teamwork during classes. The design of the formative assessment helps student self-motivation and encourages responsibility before classes and support students?\u00c2\u0080? development of knowledge and intellectual abilities both before and during classes. The teamwork in the class is important for development of collaboration and communication skills and helps students build their confidence and resilience.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nTutorials:\n\nStudents are required to do assigned reading and based on the reading provide written answers to questions that aim to prepare students for the summative assessment.\n\nThe formative assessment adopts a progressive structure, commencing with foundation skills such as reading academic papers and advancing to more complex tasks like paper description, understanding economic context, analysing research methodologies, and culminating in critical paper assessment. This sequential approach equips students for the composition of a summative essay.\n\nStudents are encouraged to submit their assignments. Feedback on written submissions is delivered during tutorials, encompassing strengths, weaknesses, and specific areas for improvement. During tutorials, collaborative group work is emphasized, with continuous assessment of group progress and individual progress. Feedback is provided to each group, supplemented by encouragement for peer assessments, both individual and group-based.\n\nThe formative assignments are biweekly, students receive the task sufficiently in advance to allow them for preparations.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n100% individual essay, 3,500 words. The essay is a critical assessment of published journal article (LO1, LO2, LO3 and LO4).\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis, a new essay in the same format as the original assessment.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe neoclassical (or traditional) models in Finance are built on restrictive assumptions about rationality. These models are excellent benchmarks, and fare well empiricallymostof the time. However, there are specific circumstances under which the neoclassical models do not work very well. This is where Behavioural Finance steps in. Behavioural Finance extends the neoclassical models by using insights acquired in Psychology. The purpose of this unit is to provide an understanding of psychological biases which affect financial decision-making.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe unit complements other units on the degree. You will be studying similar topics in this unit as in the other Finance units, but while other units explore these topics from a neoclassical perspective (rational agents), in this unit we will adopt a behavioural approach in which experimental\/empirical evidence about human behaviour will be taken into consideration. Thus, this unit will give you a well-rounded understanding of these topics.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nOverview of content:\n\nWe will begin with the concept of market efficiency -- we will go through empirical evidence in support of and against the efficient market hypothesis. Then, we will go through various models (e.g., prospect theory, ambiguity aversion, overconfidence) to reconcile the empirical evidence which appear puzzling in light of the traditional models. Finally, we will discuss some models in corporate finance to close the unit.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit?\n\nThe unit discusses many circumstances when we do things that do not appear ?\u00c2\u0080?rational?\u00c2\u0080?. How can this be explained? Can we incorporate these insights systematically into our decision-making to improve our day-to-day lives?\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\nCritically review the Efficient Markets Hypothesis and associated empirical irregularities.Describe the nature and role of investor biases in financial decision making. Apply this knowledge to personal investment decisions.Recognize that systematic biases may be exploited to make profit.Assess and judge the merits of the behavioural assumptions.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, drop-in advice and feedback sessions, and other online learning opportunities (e.g., recorded lectures). The main lectures will contain discussion of experimental evidence (including real-time play) to motivate the need for new models. We will introduce the models, and consider empirical evidence to assess their empirical success. These ideas will be enhanced through small class tutorials. A case study will help bridge the gap from the highly simplified models covered in lectures to the applications encountered in the real-world.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment will consist of nine tutorials, including one in which there will be a discussion of a case study. Feedback will be provided in each of these. The tutorials will consist of a set of discursive and numerical questions, with solutions provided during each class. Students will be encouraged to complete the tasks prior to the tutorial so that the tutorial itself can be feedback focused. The case study is intended to bridge the gap between the simplified models discussed in the lectures and a real-world application.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThis unit will be assessed by 100% closed-book exam (2 hours). This assessment will cover ILO1, ILO2, ILO3 and ILO4.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nAny re-assessment required will be a like-for-like assessment (i.e., 100% exam).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

The econometric models presented in this unit also underpin much of the work conducted by quantitative researchers and analysts in the financial markets, and thus they represent valuable industry knowledge. The emphasis throughout the unit is on applications rather than model derivations, and students will learn how to select and implement their own models using a software package.\n\nThe unit will also explain how machine learning (ML) is supporting organisations and individuals to make more effective investment decisions. It will present a range of applications of ML techniques to real-world problems in finance such as credit scoring, document sentiment assessment, return prediction, market and liquidity risk measurement, automated financial advice.\n\nHow does this unit fit within your programme of study?\n\nThis unit covers the core material on the analytical techniques of finance and financial technology that will be used in the Algorithmic Trading and Empirical Finance for Financial Technology units undertaken in teaching block 2. At this early stage in the programme, participants will learn vital industry skills in the handling and analysis of large and complex datasets. Students will be able to compare and contrast the more contemporary and sophisticated techniques that are the subject matter of ML with the more conventional classical statistical models used in econometrics, noting their relative strengths and weaknesses. Students will undertake empirical applications of machine learning techniques using a programming language, which they can draw on when conducting analysis as part of their dissertations. Examples and implementations of the methods covered in this unit will also be presented in several other units, including Finance and Algorithmic Trading. Quantitative Methods, Big Data and Machine Learning will lay the groundwork for the statistical aspects of these units and several of the optional units and many students will apply the techniques they learn on this unit in their Dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of the content\n\nThis unit introduces the econometric techniques most commonly used in finance, including OLS regression basics, time-series analysis, and panel data and its methods. Students will learn how to interpret fitted empirical models from statistical and financial perspectives.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the financial services sector and is being used across a range of areas including trading, portfolio construction and evaluation, risk management, financial intermediation and corporate finance. Collecting, storing, and analysing the phenomenal quantities of relevant data being created each day is challenging and requires novel approaches and significant computing power. Distributed leger systems are changing the way that organisations and individuals keep records of transactions and make payments. Their impacts are likely to grow substantively as digital records systems based on this technology become more widely implemented, but already, blockchain technologies are finding uses in payments and lending, transaction settlement, insurance and contract recording. At the same time, the prices of cryptocurrencies (the digital financial products that rely on this infrastructure) have been highly volatile, creating both opportunities for speculation and significant risks for those transacting with them. This unit will provide a broad-based introduction to how blockchain techniques are being used to make cheaper and better financial products as well as making financial transactions faster, and it will discuss the ethical issues around their implementation.\n\nHow does this unit fit within your programme of study?This unit studies one of the core aspects of financial technology. The unit can be considered a complement to Quantitative Methods, Big Data and Machine Learning, and some of the techniques learned there can be applied in the context of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nNumerous hedge funds and investment banks use algorithmic trading as a source of significant profits.As a result, they are a source of asset price movements. Analysing how they operate supports a solid understanding of how financial markets function and why they can break down (such as the occurrence of ?\u00c2\u0080?flash crashes?\u00c2\u0080?). The development and testing of trading rules also represent a key application of machine learning tools.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit builds upon the Quantitative Methods, Big Data and Machine Learning studied in Teaching Block 1, to present, understand and operationalise algorithmic trading rules using a programming language. The unit makes use of the statistical models taught in TB1 and concurrently in Empirical Finance for Financial Technology to develop and appraise trading rules. It is likely that many students will employ the techniques and practical skills learned on this unit in their dissertations.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit will begin by examining the market structures that exist and explaining how an order book operates. It will then proceed to present and discuss different types of trading strategies that can be utilised. The characteristic features of high frequency financial data will be examined. Students will be taught how to code up a trading strategy, back-test it and evaluate its performance using a range of metrics. Techniques for risk measurement and risk management of trading strategies will be illustrated using real data. The potential impact of algorithmic trading on the efficiency of asset markets and its interaction with the wider market will be highlighted and discussed.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents will deepen their analytical abilities and will be able to translate abstract trading ideas into functioning coded models. In so-doing, students will develop new industry-relevant trading and programming skills.\n\nIndependent learning outcomes\n\nUpon successful completion, students will be able to:\n\nSummarise and classify high frequency trading strategiesAnalyse high frequency financial data for exploitable patternsDiscuss and contrast trade execution approachesDesign a computer program to implement a range of trading strategies and evaluate their performance using a range of metrics\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe conceptual details of market microstructure and trading strategy development will be presented in lectures. Via case studies and computer-based simulations of financial market variables, students will learn how hedge funds and other market participants detect and exploit predictable patterns in financial data. This unit will be closely linked with industry practices and will be highly practical, with one of its primary purposes to provide students with the tools to be able to implement their own algorithms. Computer lab sessions will be used for this purpose, where students will be provided with existing code which they can then modify to suit different objectives, applying it to real financial data. The implementations will not be mechanical, but will begin from a high-level understanding of how to design and structure code from first principles.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you to learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nStudents will participate in tutorials where non-assessed problem sets that they have prepared in advance will be discussed and generic oral feedback will be offered. There will also be computer lab classes where students will work individually and in small groups to see how financial markets function and they will implement and evaluate trading strategies using a programming language (such as Python).They will be provided with oral feedback on their progress and solution code will be distributed on problems not covered during the lab sessions.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nStudents will individually implement relevant application of algorithmic trading, which could, for example, involve setting up a simulated market or technical trading rule, which they will then test in a programming language (e.g., Python), ILO1, ILO2, ILO3 and ILO4. Students will write a report of up to 2,000 words describing their methods and findings. They will be provided with the opportunity to attend clinics during the time that they are preparing their projects to gain support and feedback on any problems they are encountering. Students will submit their code and report for assessment, which together will constitute 100% of the mark for the unit.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, students will work on a further individual project along the same lines as the original assessment and will submit their code and report for grading.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0015).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important\n\nThe Dissertation is the pinnacle of the MSc in Financial Technology, and provides students with an opportunity to execute a piece of original research on a topic that they choose. Where the student desires it, in some cases there may be the opportunity to work with an industry partner, who will provide specialist additional guidance and access to financial market problems and data, alongside the academic supervisor.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit runs throughout the academic year. Across TB1 and TB2, lectures and seminars will prepare students for independently conducting empirical research in finance. In TB1 there will be a welcome talk from the programme director and lectures on the structure of the dissertation and how to conduct a literature review. In TB2, there will be lectures and tutorials on research methods which will equip students with the skills necessary to critically evaluate the academic literature and produce original research for the dissertation report. In TB3, students will produce and present a research proposal, and complete the dissertation.\n\nStudents will apply and hone the broad skills in time management, critical thinking, and report writing that they developed in the other units. Depending on their choice of topic, students are also likely to extend their subject matter knowledge in a more specialised area from units such as Quantitative Methods, Big Data and Machine Learning (TB 1); AI, Blockchain Technology and Applications (TB 1); or Algorithmic Trading (TB2).\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nStudents will choose their own topic, which will probably be on an aspect of financial technology of relevance to the financial services sector. They will study it in depth, analysing the problem at hand in detail.\n\nHow will students personally be different as a result of the unit\n\nIn addition to synthesising the knowledge and skills learned on previous aspects of the programme, students will hone their independent study, time-management, presentation delivery and report-writing skills. They will also be required to reflect on and deal with any ethical issues that might arise in conducting their research. Students will become more confident in conducting research, and they will develop resilience and tenacity to deal with problems as they occur.\n\nIntended learning outcomes\n\nUpon successful completion, students will be able to:\n\nDesign and execute a piece of independent research, selecting appropriate methodsConduct and write up a critical literature reviewDraft an appropriately structured and substantive report that details their methods and findings, presenting information in a logical and clear mannerPrepare and deliver an oral presentation and respond appropriately to questions about its content\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will be allocated an appropriate supervisor based on their topic choice. The interaction they have with their supervisor will be very personalised and dependent upon the nature of the subject matter (for example, theoretical versus empirical).\n\nAdditional optional seminars are offered that will be relevant for some topics, such as on the use of specialist databases, and a technical ?\u00c2\u0080?help desk?\u00c2\u0080? is provided during the main study period to offer support with programming or statistical issues.\n\nWhere students request it, and where such opportunities are available, they will have the option to work on an industry-related topic and will receive additional guidance, and possibly specialist data and other information, from an industry key contact at a financial technology firm. In such cases, the academic supervisor will remain responsible for ongoing support and for the final assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you to learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative)\n\nStudents will receive initial feedback on their research proposal and will also receive comments and suggestions on their ideas and emerging findings through regular on-line or in-person supervision meetings. There will typically be individual meetings, but they may be organised on a small group basis when this is useful in situations where two or more students are working within a cognate area. Supervisors will also be available for ad hoc consultation via e-mail.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\n25% - 2000-word Individual coursework to be submitted towards the end of TB2. This component focuses on assessing students?\u00c2\u0080? knowledge on working with relevant secondary data sources; developing empirical strategies; navigating the academic literature and writing in a formal style. (ILO5, ILO6)\n\n10% - The Dissertation Proposal, comprises a written component and a 10-minute in-person presentation. For the written component, students are expected to prepare a 1000-word proposal on their chosen topic, which may include a survey of the literature and outline future research steps. The presentation provides an opportunity for students to share their ideas with their allocated supervisor and a small group of peers who have chosen a similar topic. If a student has exceptional circumstances that mean they are unable to do a presentation, an alternative assessment will be arranged (ILO4)\n\n65% - Dissertation report. This will be a 7000-word dissertation prepared on the basis of original research conducted by the student.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nFinancial Modelling bridges the gap between theory and practice, equipping students with the knowledge and tools that are needed to solve real-world problems that are faced by investment banks, fund management companies and other financial institutions. The unit introduces students to the general principles of financial modelling, the use of financial data, as well as methodological tools that are useful for implementing a financial model, such as matrix operations, numerical optimisation, sensitivity analysis and simulation. These methods are applied to a wide range of applications in finance drawn from investment analysis, corporate finance, fixed income analysis, risk management and financial econometrics. The emphasis of the unit is on practical application of the theory through the extensive use of realistic case studies that students solve using Excel, VBA and, optionally, Python.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nFinancial Modelling builds on several units delivered in Teaching Block 1, including Asset Pricing and Fundamentals of Corporate Finance. In particular, it provides students with the tools to implement some of the theories and concepts that are covered in these units in a real-world setting through the extensive use of practical case studies. It also complements several of the optional units that are delivered in Teaching Block 2, such as Derivatives and Investment Management, by extending some of the material that is covered by these units to include models and techniques that are widely used in the finance industry.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit covers both the general principles of financial modelling and the specific tools that prove to be useful to implement a financial model in practice. These techniques are illustrated with a wide range of applications in finance drawn from investment analysis, corporate finance, fixed income analysis, risk management and financial econometrics, including the estimation of the required returns on debt and equity, construction of optimal passive and active investment portfolios, forecasting the volatility of financial asset returns and the estimation of portfolio risk. The emphasis of the unit is on practical application of the theory, with lectures on each topic followed by in-depth practical classes in which students work through comprehensive realistic case studies using Excel, VBA and, optionally, Python.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThe unit develops in students the ability to solve some of the practical challenges that they are likely to encounter in a career in the finance industry. In so doing students will acquire not only an understanding of the principles and practice of financial modelling, but also valuable transferable analytical skills such as the ability to analyse data and write a professional report, as well as proficiency in Excel, VBA and Python.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the unit, students should be able to:\n\nDesign and implement a financial model to address a specific problem in finance using appropriate data and modelling techniques.To critically assess the robustness of a financial model with respect to sources of uncertainty, and hence the establish the reliability and usefulness of the conclusions drawn.Present the results and conclusions of a financial model in a clear and precise way.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of lectures, exercise lectures and online clinics. Lectures will cover the principles and methods of financial modelling, illustrated with extensive practical examples. In the exercise lectures, students will work through practical case studies that allow them to implement, under guidance, what they have learned in the lectures. The online clinics give students the opportunity to raise and discuss questions related to any aspect of the unit, including the lecture material, practical case studies and the formative and summative assessment.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nStudents will undertake a group assignment of similar form to that of the individual summative assessment (see below), with written feedback provided on the content and presentation of the submitted report.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThe unit is assessed by a single individual assignment (2,500 words) in which students will use the financial modelling techniques that they have learned to solve a comprehensive practical case study, and write up the details of the financial model together with their results and conclusions into a professionally presented report. The assignment tests ILO1, ILO2 and ILO3.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nThe re-assessment will take the same form as the original assessment.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0040).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nInvestment is the process by which a household or firm acquires asset holdings that are suited to their individual needs. Investment theory provides us with deep conceptual insights and powerful quantitative tools for this process. Professional fund managers, financial analysts, financial advisers and wealth managers all rely on these insights and tools. The unit lets you develop key competences for such roles.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe TB2 unit is offered as an elective to several finance-related programmes in which the TB1 unit ECONM2035 Asset Pricing is also available. ECONM2035 is a pre-requisite for the present unit; the elective ECONM2030 picks up key themes of the earlier mandatory unit and develops these further.\n\nTaking part in this unit will enable you to gain maturity in your understanding of portfolio management decisions and it will give you a reliable conceptual and analytical framework for the assessment of concrete investment vehicles. In terms of your MSc studies, the unit also opens up a wide range of relevant topics for your summer dissertation.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit provides you with a unifying conceptual framework for portfolio decisions, based on the mean-variance and factor-model approaches from Asset Pricing. We focus on the tension between ?\u00c2\u0080?active investment?\u00c2\u0080? (finding sources of superior performance) and ?\u00c2\u0080?passive investment?\u00c2\u0080? (utilising the information-gathering and diversification powers of competitive markets). The key to active management is the processing of specialist information, and we study how such information is translated into buy or sell decisions (Fisher\/Black, Black\/Litterman, Grinold\/Kahn). Based on the underlying optimisation model, we identify suitable measures of a fund manager?\u00c2\u0080?s performance. Beyond the active-passive dichotomy, we learn how to construct ?\u00c2\u0080?factor investing?\u00c2\u0080? funds that reflect specific investment styles (such as momentum strategies or value investing).\n\nOur theoretical studies will be accompanied by concrete modelling work in Excel.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe derivatives market is perhaps the most important asset class. Even in a single day, on one exchange and market, trading volumes are huge. Understanding how these complex instruments are priced is important for understanding how risk can be managed. By studying this unit, you will acquire mathematical and analytical tools and problem-solving skills, which will be applicable in a wide range of disciplines and real-world situations. Moreover, knowledge of derivatives can open opportunities for further education and careers in fields that rely on mathematical modelling and analysis. Studying derivatives is also intellectually satisfying and can improve your ability to think critically and to solve complex problems.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThe unit complements other units on the degree. While derivatives will be introduced in core units, this unit will introduce further material and more challenging problems to deepen understanding. Moreover, as the unit is also available in MSc degrees in which derivatives has not been previously covered, a first principle thinking approach is adopted to promote inclusion.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit will be divided into three sections, each covering a particular type of derivative. The sections will cover forwards and futures, swaps, and options. The bulk of content will be contained in the final section such that an in-depth analysis of options will be undertaken.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nA deep understanding of derivatives will be obtained, together with a set of analytic tools and problem-solving skills. These will be applicable in a wide range of disciplines and real-world situations.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit students should be able to (inter alia):\n\n1. Analyse how financial derivatives are valued, and explain how these instruments can be used to implement risk management strategies.\n\n2. Critically discuss the practical usefulness of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.\n\n3. Appreciate the latest developments in derivative modelling and understand the latest problems in pricing complex derivatives.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions including lectures, tutorials, drop-in advice and feedback sessions, and other online learning opportunities. The main lectures will contain descriptions of methodologies and simplified examples to enhance applied and problem-solving skills. These will be enhanced through exercise lectures and small class tutorials. A case study lecture will help bridge the gap from the highly simplifies examples covered in lectures and tutorials to detailed applications of methodologies encountered in industry.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment will consist of four tutorials, four class tests, and a test associated with a case study. Feedback will be provided in each of these. The tutorials will consist of a set of discussive and numerical questions, with solutions provided during each class. Students will be encouraged to complete the tasks prior to the tutorial so that the tutorial itself can be feedback focused. The class tests will be closed book, each consisting of a set of questions that are similar in nature to those on the final examination. These tests will take place in the first hour of the exercise lecture, with the solutions discussed in the second hour. Feedback is provided via peer marking. A final test will be based on a case study. The case study is intended to bridge the gap between the simplified applications discussed in the lectures and a real-world application of derivatives knowledge. The test will be one hour in duration and will take place in the exercise class, with the second hour used for peer-based marking\/feedback.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThis unit will be assessed by 100% closed-book exam (2 hours) covering ILO1, ILO2 and ILO3.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of banks and tools that facilitate managerial decision making within banks. As such it provides an introduction to the assessment, measurement, and management of various types of risks that banks face, e.g., market risk and credit risk.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis unit is offered as an optional unit in MSc Banking, Regulation, and Financial Stability and MSc Financial Technology, complementing other units in this degree programme from the perspective of risk management in the banking context.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit introduces students to the management decisions banks make. The unit will focus primarily on assessing and managing bank risks, e.g., credit risk, market risk, etc. However, other business decisions, such as the type of lending a bank engages in, or its geographic and organisational structure, will also be addressed.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nStudents learn how to critically assess and manage various types of risk that banks may face. Students learn to work with data in Excel to manage such risks.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit students will be able to:\n\nRecognise the trade-offs banks face when making management decisions.Identify and critically evaluate the main concepts used to evaluate a bank?\u00c2\u0080?s performance.Assess the risks banks typically face.Discuss and employ credit, market, and operational risk models.Apply various risk management tools.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nTeaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions including lectures, tutorials, drop-in advice and feedback sessions, and other online learning opportunities (e.g., clinics). The eight two-hour lectures will take place in a traditional lecture setting. However, all efforts will be made to ensure lectures are as engaging and interactive as possible with the active use of student questioning, and student participation. Two of the lectures will include demonstration of the use of Excel in calculation of VaRs in practical settings. Complementary to the lectures there are six one-hour tutorials which are intended to provide students with a forum in which they can further and consolidate their understanding of the lecture content. Lecture slides, problem sets, and sample solutions to problem sets will be made available online.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment is articulated over multiple problem sets that are circulated progressively during the unit. Students are given time to attempt solving the problems by themselves, and actual solutions are subsequently explained and discussed in tutorial sessions. These problems are similar to those in the summative assessments, and therefore provide students with a good sense of their ability to perform. Furthermore, students also have access to a sample summative assessment that they can use to test their knowledge.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nExam 60% (2 hours) covering ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4 and ILO5.\n\nIndividual coursework 40% covering ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4 and ILO5. The individual coursework requires the students to independently make reasonable judgements on a topic of risk management related to banking by critically reflecting on appropriate learning resources, analysing data, and critically evaluating findings in a report of up to 2000 words.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nAny re-assessment required will be a like-for-like assessment for the exam and\/or coursework(s).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0043).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThe unit will combine examination of leading academic papers in the credit ratings literature with practical sessions in which students build their own credit scoring models. We also employ an industry-based model for determining portfolio credit risk (Credit Metrics) and all material has been provided by the authors of the Credit Metrics system. The unit will be supported by computer lab workshops based in SAS software and this is also an opportunity for students to learn about a leading data analysis software system. All theoretical work is linked directly to practical sessions, thereby helping students to understand not just the theory, but also the relevance of this theory in practice.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study\n\nThis course has an empirical focus to help support students during their dissertation. It complements the course in Banking and follows on from the courses in asset pricing (bonds) and corporate finance (capital structure) to understand a major source of risk in capital markets, which is primarily related to debt instruments.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThis unit will cover credit risk, hazard models, the Merton (1974) model, credit ratings and portfolio credit risk via CreditMetrics. We employ SAS software in both lectures and workshops. A new cloud-based version of SAS will be available for 2024\/2025.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThis course allows students to apply the theory they learn to devising their own models of credit risk. Students will learn how to devise credit risk models based on both academic and industry practices. They will learn how to use SAS software for this purpose.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of the unit students will be able to\n\nDescribe credit risk and why it needs to be measured.Evaluate models of the credit risk of individual corporations and instruments, following leading academic papers.Critically evaluate credit ratingsExplain credit risk within a portfolio context employing the method of CreditMetrics.Use SAS software and\/or excel to:\n\n(a) Construct models for the evaluation of the credit risk of individual corporations and instruments, following leading academic papers.\n\n(b) Construct a ratings-based credit scoring model.\n\n(c) Apply the Credit Metrics method to determine portfolio credit risk.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nThe learning approach is interactive and applied. Student feedback suggests that students welcome the chance to put the theoretical material into practice as this considerably enhances their understanding of the material.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nQuestions can be raised during the lecture or via email about all lecture material, and the lecturer will guide students through the answers to these(ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4).An excel spreadsheet illustrating calculations is available to support lectures(ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4).Feedback on a piece of non-assessed coursework will be provided by a fellow student on the course. Providing feedback to others is an excellent means of improving understanding of course material and gaining ideas from others. It is a key means via which academics learn from and support each other. Full details of this feedback scheme appear in the workbooks.(ILO1)Workshop material is posted to Blackboard at the end of each workshop for students to check their code and their answers.(IL05(a), ILO5(b), ILO5(c)).The workshops will allow students the opportunity to put the theory they learn into practice by constructing a range of credit scoring models for individual corporations and for portfolios(IL05(a), ILO5(b) and ILO5(c)).\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nThe unit is assessed via a 1.5 hour examination (50% of the final mark) and group coursework, maximum four sides of A4 paper in Times New Roman 12 font (50% of the final mark).\n\nThe exam will require students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of credit risk and the theory behind the empirical models designed to measure credit risk. The exam will contain a combination of qualitative and quantitative questions, which will require students to demonstrate that they understand the various models that are used to quantify credit risks(ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4). In addition, the exam will test the students?\u00c2\u0080? ability to think critically and communicate effectively in writing under exam conditions.\n\nIn the assessed coursework, students work in teams to devise their own credit scoring models and critically evaluate them against models reported in prior literature(ILO1, ILO2, ILO4, ILO5).\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nA resit exam will be based on the same ILOs as the first sit(ILO1, ILO2, ILO3, ILO4). The resit coursework will be single rather than groupwork and will require students to devise a model and critically evaluate it(ILO1, ILO2, ILO4, ILO5).\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit.

Unit Information\n\nWhy is this unit important?\n\nThis unit is designed to equip students with an understanding of the firm as an institution and of some of the most relevant decisions made in companies?\u00c2\u0080? C-suites, as well as of how these decisions are intertwined with the corporate ecosystem. The unit expands the set of topics that are typically covered in basic courses of corporate finance, including Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Fundamentals of Finance. Subjects covered in this unit range from the corporate processes of raising capital by issuing debt (e.g. bonds, loans, commercial paper) and equity (e.g. venture capital, IPOs, SEOs), to the acquisition of other companies (e.g. mergers, acquisitions, LBOs) and the associated implications for corporate governance (e.g. shareholders vs directors, executive compensation). These and other relevant issues are discussed with a pragmatic approach that bridges corporate finance theory with real examples and institutional details of the environment in which actual companies operate.\n\nHow does this unit fit into your programme of study?\n\nThis unit is a natural extension to the more fundamental units covering Fundamentals of Corporate Finance and Fundamentals of Finance. Conceived as an optional unit in multiple programmes in Finance, Accounting and Economics, it is oriented to those students that seek a broader understanding of thecorporationas an entity, and of some of the most critical decisions that are made in it for both the long and the short run. The central role of firms in the financial ecosystem, and the practical approach adopted in this unit, make of it a sound complement to any other unit offered in these programmes.\n\nYour learning on this unit\n\nAn overview of content\n\nThe unit covers key concepts of the firm?\u00c2\u0080?s structure and addresses critical topics in corporate decision-making. A first section discusses how market frictions determine the desirability of distinct capital structures. Next, the unit covers the means of raising capital via securities like debt or equity in distinct stages of the corporate life cycle. This is followed by a section that studies corporate governance and the market for corporate control, including mergers and acquisitions. Finally, the unit addresses a set of other relevant topics such as risk management and short-term financing.\n\nHow will students, personally, be different as a result of the unit\n\nThis unit will equip students with a comprehensive view of the firm and the institutional setting in which it operates. This will enable students improve their understanding of the impact that some corporate decisions have on the multiple elements of the firm. Furthermore, the unit is structured over a coherent framework that facilitates a formal approach to the multiple concepts that are covered. By solving and discussing simple numerical exercises based on this framework, students will experience the benefits of formalising real-world problems.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the unit a successful student will be able to:\n\nDiscuss how market frictions determine the desirable choice of capital structure of a company.Explain the corporate means of raising capital via debt and equity in distinct stages of a firms?\u00c2\u0080? life cycle.Identify the implications of the different forms of payment for corporate acquisitions.Evaluate the tensions that motivate the regulatory framework that shapes corporate governance.Identify the main elements of working capital and their role on short-term financial planning.Discuss key sources of corporate risk and explain financial instruments employed to mitigate this risk.\n\nHow you will learn\n\nHow you will learn\n\nStudents will learn over a combination of lectures and tutorials. Each lecture addresses a particular topic and is designed to provide students with a conceptual framework that facilitates the analysis of the subject. Lectures are compact and self-coherent, so they provide a structured, well-defined view of the content to students.\n\nIn tutorials, the lecturer explains and discusses with students problems that are based on the content delivered in lectures. These problems are generally numerical and technically very easy. However, they can be challenging on their set up, giving value to the concepts previously explained in lectures. Importantly, the discussion of these problems in tutorials shall establish explicit links to both the corresponding lectures and examples in the real World.\n\nHow you will be assessed\n\nTasks which help you learn and prepare you for summative tasks (formative):\n\nFormative assessment is articulated over multiple problem sets that are circulated progressively during the unit. Students are given time to attempt solving the problems by themselves, and actual solutions are subsequently explained and discussed in tutorial sessions. These problems are similar to those in the summative assessment, and therefore provide students with a good sense of their ability to perform. In addition to the problem sets, students are given a questionnaire aimed at assessing their current knowledge of the subject in the last lecture. Furthermore, students also have access to a sample summative assessment that they can use to test their knowledge.\n\nTasks which count towards your unit mark (summative):\n\nA unique final exam of 2 hours (120 minutes). The exam consists of five parts, each worth 20% of the final mark. Each part assesses the content of a specific set of lectures and the corresponding problem sets. Each part consists of a short conceptual question and multiple numerical exercises. The exam has no options, i.e., all questions must be answered, and it tests all Intended Learning Objectives: LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5, and LO6.\n\nWhen assessment does not go to plan\n\nWhen a student fails the unit and is eligible to resubmit, failed components will be reassessed on a like-for-like basis with the same structure and level of difficulty than the final assessment.\n\nResources\n\nIf this unit has a Resource List, you will normally find a link to it in the \r\n          Blackboard area for the unit. Sometimes there will be a separate link for each \r\n          weekly topic.\n\nIf you are unable to access a list through Blackboard, you can also find it\r\n          via theResource Lists homepage.Search for the list by the unit name or code (e.g. ACFIM0021).\n\nHow much time the unit requiresEach credit equates to 10 hours of total student input. For example a 20 credit unit will take you 200 hours \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof study to complete. Your total learning time is made up of contact time, directed learning tasks, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent learning and assessment activity.\n\nSee theUniversity Workload statementrelating to this unit for more information.\n\nAssessmentThe assessment methods listed in this unit specification are designed to enable students to demonstrate the named learning outcomes (LOs). Where a disability prevents a student from undertaking a specific method of assessment, schools will make reasonable adjustments to support a student to demonstrate the LO by an alternative method or with additional resources.The Board of Examiners will consider all cases where students have failed or not completed the assessments required for credit.\r\n                                        The Board considers each student's outcomes across all the units which contribute to each year's programme of study. For appropriate assessments, if you have self-certificated your absence, you will normally be required to complete it the next time it runs (for assessments at the end of TB1 and TB2 this is usually in the next re-assessment period).The Board of Examiners will take into account any exceptional circumstances and operates\r\n                                        within theRegulations and Code of Practice for Taught Programmes.
